    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;so i've been working with minimax 2.5 (MiniMax-M2.5-UD-Q3_K_XL),&lt;br /&gt; im amazed by this model, the quality of code is just on another level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;my issue is that i can only work with it in maximum 65K context (bigger than that - crashes on load - out of memory) , normal usage lands on 125GB RAM usage (which is too much).&lt;br /&gt; so i decided to try MiniMax-M2.5-UD-Q2_K_XL, which runs fine with context of 192K,&lt;br /&gt; but i wonder whats the difference between the two models when it comes to coding ?&lt;br /&gt; anyone ever run coding benchmark on both of Q2 and Q3 ?&lt;br /&gt; i didnt find any info online...&lt;br /&gt; im sure Q3 is better, but by how much ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/DOOMISHERE"&gt; /u/DOOMISHERE &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rcalyu/minimax_25_on_dgx_spark_system/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rcalyu/minimax_25_on_dgx_spark_system/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Many 7B–8B models are already good enough for daily use if you care more about privacy/control than squeezing out the last 5% of quality&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Consumer and prosumer hardware keeps getting cheaper and more powerful, especially GPUs and Apple Silicon–class chips. People are already running decent local LLMs with 12–16GB VRAM or optimized CPU-only setups for chat and light coding&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;At some point, the default might flip: instead of why would you run this locally?, the real question becomes why would you ship your entire prompt and codebase to a third-party API if you don’t strictly need to? For a lot of use cases (personal coding, offline agents, sensitive internal tools), a strong local open model plus a specialized smaller model might be more than enough&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/tiguidoio"&gt; /u/tiguidoio &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rc00nj/in_the_long_run_everything_will_be_local/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rc00nj/in_the_long_run_everything_will_be_local/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

So, Is it the next big thing?" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I put the Q8 MLX on my 128GB Mac Studio Ultra and wired it to Qwen Code CLI. Fit's there with a huge amount to spare. The first tests were promising - basically did everything I asked: read file, write file, browse web, check system time....blah, blah.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the real the task:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I decided on YOLO mode to rewrite the KittenTTS-IOS to windows (which itself is a rewrite of KittenTTS in python). It uses ONYX and a couple of Swift libraries like Misaki for English phoneme.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, say a medium difficulty. Not super easy, but not super hard, because all the code is basically there. You just need to shake it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is how it went:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Started very well. Plan was solid. Make simple CLI with KittenTTS model, avoid any phoneme manipulation for now. Make ONYX work. Then add Misaki phoneme, avoid bart fallback coz that's a can of worms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;So it built the main.cpp. Rewrote the main app, created it's own json parser for the KittenTTS dictionary. found windows ONYX, downloaded, linked. ran cmake captured the output, realised it's json parsing was a total crap. Linked &amp;lt;nlohmann/json.hpp&amp;gt; .... aaaaand we are out.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;First client timeout then &amp;quot;I'm dead, Dave&amp;quot;. As we get more and more into longer context the prompt parsing gets longer and longer until the client times out.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Restarted maually, told it we are at json.hpp, it finished the patching, compiled - created output.wav&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I'm impressed so far. The wav has voice in it, of course all gibberish because we have no phoneme dictionary. The make file is unreadable can of worms.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Next step convert phoneme Misaki to windows. Big hairy project. Again, started cheerful. But we are now editing large files. It can barely finish anything before timeout.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Lot's of manual restarts. (YOLO mode my butt, right?). At some point it starts editing the Swift files, thinking that's what we are doing. Noooo!!!!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I've noticed that most of the time it wastes tokens on trying to figure out how to do stuff like save file it wants to save, because now &amp;quot;it's just too big&amp;quot;. Even starts writing python script to save the file then entering the entire text of lexicon.cpp as a command line - LOL, learning, that's a very stupid thing too.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I mean nice to learn from mistakes, but we are getting to timeouts all the time now by filling the context with unnecessary work. And it of course learns nothing, because that knowledge is lost.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I spent another 60 minutes trying to figure out how to fix qwen code by increasing timeout. Not an easy task as every AI will just hallucinate what you should do. I moved from anthropic style to openai style for the QWEN3 and set generationConfig.timeout to a big number (I have no idea if this even works). Set the KV_cache to quantize at 8 bit in LM studio (again, no idea if it helps). Seems the timeouts are now longer? So maybe a small win?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Well, went to sleep, letting it do something.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;In the next day the phoneme test.exe was working sort of (at least it was not throwing 5 pages of errors) - read the 400k phoneme dictionary and output bunch of nonsense, like lookup: Hello -&amp;gt; h╔ÖlO (Is this the correct phoneme? Hardly. Seems we are getting lost in ISO/UDF nightmare) Well, Qwen doesn't know what's going on either.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;At this point neither me nor Qwen knows if we are fixing bugs or buggyfying working code. But he is happily doing something.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;And writing jokes that get a bit stale after while: &amp;quot;Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't C#&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I start to miss Claude Code. Or Codex. Or anything that doesn't take 30 minutes per turn then tell me client timeout.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It is still fixing it and writing stupid one liner jokes on screen. I mean &amp;quot;fixing it&amp;quot; means sitting in Prompt processing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Funny, MAC Studio is barely warm. Like it was working nonstop for 8 hours with 89GB model .&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The processing prompt is still killing the whole operation. As the context grows, this is a few minutes per turn.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I totally believe the X grifters telling me they bough 10 MAC's for local Agentic work.... yes, sure. You can have huge memory but large context is still going to be snail pace.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;19. Looking at the terminal &amp;quot;Just a sec, I'm optimizing the humor... (esc to cancel, 29m 36s)&amp;quot;, been doing something for 30 min. Looking at mac log, generating token, now at around 60k tokens and still going up - a really long output that we will probably never be able to do anything with.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I give Local model coding 5/10 so far. It does kinda work if you have the enormous patience. It's surprising we get that far. It is nowhere what the big boys give you, even for $20/month.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;--- It is still coding --- (definitely now in some Qwen3 loop)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/44qd636p15lg1.png?width=599&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c6af08a0a84011baa5dc72985d73634bbe04a35f"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/44qd636p15lg1.png?width=599&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c6af08a0a84011baa5dc72985d73634bbe04a35f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Whee! We finished, about 24 hours after I started. Now, of course I wasn't babysitting it so IDK how much time it sat idle during the day. Anytime I went by I'd check on it, or restart the process...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The whole thing had to restart or run probably 20-30 times again and again on the same thing for various reasons (timeout or infinite loops).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, the good thing is: &lt;strong&gt;The project compiles and creates a WAV file with very understandable pronunciation all on just CPU that doesn't sound robotic.&lt;/strong&gt; So that's 100% success. No coding input from my side, no code fixing. No dependencies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It isn't pleasant to work with it in this capacity I tried (MAC Studio with forever prompt processing) but beggars cannot be choosers and Qwen3-coder-next is a &lt;strong&gt;FREE&lt;/strong&gt; model. So yay, they (Qwen) need to be commanded for their effort. It's amazing how fast we got there, and I remember that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm bumping the result to 6/10 for a local coding experience which is: &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final observations and what I learned:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- It's free, good enough, and runs on a home hardware which back in 2023 would be called &amp;quot;insane&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- it can probably work better with small editing/bug fixes/ small additions. The moment it needs to write large code it will be full of issues (if it finishes). It literally didn't wrote a single usable code at once (unlike what I used to see in cc or codex), though it was able to fix all the hundreds issues by itself (testing, assessing, fixing). The process itself took a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- it didn't really have problem with tool calling, at least not what I observed. It had problem with tool using, especially when it started producing a lot of code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- it is NOT a replacement for claude/codex/gemini/other cloud. It just isn't. Maybe as a hobby. It's the difference between a bicycle and a car. You will get there eventually, but it would take much longer and be less pleasant. Well it depends how much you value your time vs money, I guess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- MAC with unified memory is amazing, for a basic general LLM, but working with code and long context it kills any enjoyment - and that is not dependent on the size of the memory. When the grifters on X saying they are buying 512GB MAC studios for local agentic coding etc - it's BS. It's still a torture - because we have much faster and less painful way using cloud API (and cheaper too). It's pain with 80GB 8 bit quantized model, it would be excruciating with full 250GB model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- I'm not going to lie to you, I'm not going to use it much, unless I terribly ran out of tokens on cc or codex. I'd check other Chinese big online models that are much cheaper like GLM 5, but honestly the price alone is not deterrent. I firmly believe they (codex, cc) are giving it practically for free. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- I might check other models like step 3.5 (I have it downloaded but didn't use it for anything yet)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/FPham"&gt; /u/FPham &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rc1ra2/my_realworld_qwen3codenext_local_coding_test_so/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rc1ra2/my_realworld_qwen3codenext_local_coding_test_so/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

It never generates the final answer itself. Its system prompt is literally &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;You are good at using tools.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; It's useless without the full ToolOrchestra ensemble running behind it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What TeichAI's models actually are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look at the model card:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;textBase Model: unsloth/Qwen3-8B-unsloth-bnb-4bit Dataset: TeichAI/claude-4.5-opus-high-reasoning-250x &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's it. It's Qwen3-8B SFT'd on Claude Opus 4.5 reasoning traces using Unsloth + TRL. Standalone general reasoning assistant. No routing, no tool delegation, no specialist ensemble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nothing wrong with that as a model - distillation from frontier models onto small open weights is a legitimate and useful technique. But calling it &amp;quot;Nemotron-Orchestrator&amp;quot; is pure name-jacking to ride branding. It has nothing architecturally or functionally in common with the actual Orchestrator-8B.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can someone from the TeichAi team clarify this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; If you downloaded these expecting routing/orchestration behavior, you got a general reasoning fine-tune. If you want the actual ToolOrchestra system, you need NVIDIA's model &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; a full ensemble of specialist backends - the orchestrator alone does nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you see it is actually a better model &amp;amp; performant without the harness, please comment and inform us all!

    <title>Hardware requirements for training a ~3B Model From Scratch locally?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m a data science master’s student who’s posted on here a couple times before over the last year or 2. Now am working on my senior thesis and I’m trying to figure out the feasibility of training a ~3B parameter transformer model from scratch. So not fine-tuning. I’m trying to figure out what’s realistically doable on a home setup within ~6 months. My school is unfortunately is a very small public school and doesn’t have their own cluster or anything like that. Prior to this I was at a bigger school that did so I was just planning on booking time using theirs but unfortunately last year I had to transfer because I got really sick as they didn’t make accommodations for folks with medical disability. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways I was thinking about training something in the ball park of 3B Params, 2k context, 25/50b training tokens, in fp16, probably using AdamW. My current system I have designed based on some napkin math is 2x 3090s over nvlink as I already have a Z690 motherboard that supports x8/x8 bifurcation, 1200W PSU, and 64gb of DDR5 RAM. Prior to this I had a rtx 5090 but even though it was crazy fast the 32gb was not enough to hold all the weights, grads, buffers, optimizer states (AdamW), etc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just wanted to hop on here and see if anyone here actually trained a 3B model or slightly smaller from scratch at home and if so what GPUs did you use/how did you do it? If you’ve done anything remotely similar (even 1B–2B scale), I’d love to hear your setup and how it went.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Appreciate any real-world data points , thanks 🙏&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Any-Cobbler6161"&gt; /u/Any-Cobbler6161 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rckqpp/hardware_requirements_for_training_a_3b_model/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rckqpp/hardware_requirements_for_training_a_3b_model/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

The graph variant excels at temporal queries (58.1% vs OpenAI's 21.7%) and multi-hop reasoning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;LangMem's 60-second latency makes it unusable for interactive applications, despite being open source.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology:&lt;/strong&gt; Used LOCOMO dataset with GPT-4o-mini at temperature 0. Evaluated factual consistency, multi-hop reasoning, temporal understanding, and open-domain recall across 26K+ token conversations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This matters because production agents need memory that persists beyond context windows while maintaining chat-level responsiveness. Current approaches either sacrifice accuracy for speed or become too slow for real-time use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/singh_taranjeet"&gt; /u/singh_taranjeet &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rckcww/benchmarked_4_ai_memory_systems_on_600turn/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rckcww/benchmarked_4_ai_memory_systems_on_600turn/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Codex was even worse, locally, leading to weird CPU switches mid-generation when there was supposed to be enough VRAM to run the model entirely on GPU. Then I tried Claude Code and that's when my expectations were exceeded, &lt;em&gt;big time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I first started with pygame, and after successfully one-shotting simple games (snake game, etc.) under the same project with the same model I decided to take it another level and use Claude Code with Godot, which was pretty easy to setup in VSCode and their IDE/extension. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next thing I know, I spend the last two weeks making this game on Godot out of curiosity and using Claude Code to help me Vibecode parts of it along the way, and I came up with this game where you have a useful, snarky NPC that makes fun of you lmao.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way it works is that the game is going to be gathering contextual information in real-time, e.g. actions taken, events occurring, etc. You can see that in the logs that are printed under the gameplay loop. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mage then stores each chain of events in a chat history and comments on it every 10 seconds. The AI behavior is hard-coded but it works really well. However, I do plan on adding a hybrid approach where the LLM uses tool calls to make informed decisions depending on the situations, such as:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Switching equipment&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Healing the player or himself&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pointing out objects of interest&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;And so forth. I haven't ruled out a Wizard of Oz worldbuilding AI that vibecodes enemies and obstacles throughout the game with tool calls, but that will be for another time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm enjoying this process so I think I might actually finish this game, but we'll see how far I can get. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/swagonflyyyy"&gt; /u/swagonflyyyy &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://v.redd.it/jl31wp5085lg1"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rc3naj/super_new_to_godot_used_claude_codegptoss120b/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

Context length does not affect VRAM usage.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;16.39 tok/s on ARM Cortex-A76 (7B model). That's a mid-range Android chip.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;28.7 tok/s on Snapdragon X Elite (7B). Current-gen Windows on ARM.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;RWKV-X hybrid: 1.37x faster than Flash Attention v3 at 128K context.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft already ships Eagle v5 (RWKV-based) on ~1.5 billion Windows machines for on-device tasks. No cloud round-trip.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The compression stack: 4-bit quantized RWKV-7 0.1B runs on microcontrollers. The state size is fixed regardless of how long the conversation runs. For local-first deployment this is a fundamentally different proposition than fitting a Transformer's growing KV cache into limited VRAM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weights (Apache 2.0): &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/RWKV/rwkv-v7-67d43835efa225006183fece"&gt;https://huggingface.co/collections/RWKV/rwkv-v7-67d43835efa225006183fece&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Happy to discuss about this. :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Sensitive-Two9732"&gt; /u/Sensitive-Two9732 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/ai-advances/rwkv-7-beats-llama-3-2-rnn-constant-memory-46064bbf1f64"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rco9v7/rwkv7_o1_memory_inference_1639_toks_on_arm/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

You can swap gender, pitch, mix and match voices, and even create an emotion space! This also enables semantic voice search!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The voice embedding model is actually just a tiny encoder with just a few million parameters. I've ripped it out of the voice embedding model so you can use the embedding model standalone. Check out my collection! :D I also have onnx models for optimized web / front-end inference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/marksverdhei/qwen3-voice-embedding"&gt;https://huggingface.co/collections/marksverdhei/qwen3-voice-embedding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Voice embedings can be used for inference in my vllm-omni fork until it is supported in upstream: &lt;a href="https://github.com/heiervang-technologies/ht-vllm-omni"&gt;https://github.com/heiervang-technologies/ht-vllm-omni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/k_means_clusterfuck"&gt; /u/k_means_clusterfuck &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.redd.it/zmcs7iysm5lg1.png"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rc59ze/qwen3s_most_underrated_feature_voice_embeddings/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>
