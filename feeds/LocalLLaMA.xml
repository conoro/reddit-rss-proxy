    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd argue using json schemas for inputs/outputs makes model interactions more reliable, especially when working on agents across different models. Mega prompts that cover all edge cases work with only one specific model. New models get released on a weekly or existing ones get updated, then older versions are discontinued and you have to start over with your prompt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why isn't schema based prompting more common practice?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/facethef"&gt; /u/facethef &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oo4sfz/schema_based_prompting/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oo4sfz/schema_based_prompting/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Users can now support higher-concurrency local inference via multi-GPU parallelism and fine-tune ultra-large models like DeepSeek 671B and Kimi K2 1TB locally, greatly expanding the scope of applications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A dedicated introduction to the Expert Deferral feature just &lt;a href="https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/12586"&gt;submitted&lt;/a&gt; to the SGLang&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, our original CPU/GPU parallel scheme left the CPU idle during MLA computation—already a bottleneck—because it only handled routed experts, forcing CPU and GPU to run alternately, which was wasteful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/7h4zt7hyj8zf1.png?width=1637&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=986fec35461ecfb03ead784b800459235017566b"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/7h4zt7hyj8zf1.png?width=1637&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=986fec35461ecfb03ead784b800459235017566b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our fix is simple: leveraging the residual network property, we defer the accumulation of the least-important few (typically 4) of the top-k experts to the next layer’s residual path. This effectively creates a parallel attn/ffn structure that increases CPU/GPU overlap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experiments (detailed numbers in our SOSP’25 &lt;a href="https://madsys.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publication/ktransformers-unleashing-the-full-potential-of-cpu/gpu-hybrid-inference-for-moe-models/SOSP25-chen.pdf"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;) show that deferring, rather than simply skipping, largely preserves model quality while boosting performance by over 30%. Such system/algorithm co-design is now a crucial optimization avenue, and we are exploring further possibilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Fine-tuning with LLaMA-Factory&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared to the still-affordable API-based inference, local fine-tuning—especially light local fine-tuning after minor model tweaks—may in fact be a more important need for the vast community of local players. After months of development and tens of thousands of lines of code, this feature has finally been implemented and open-sourced today with the help of the LLaMA-Factory community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/o3nes3sbk8zf1.png?width=1440&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=84f080c9ebfa1b3202001242174549236bc8f83d"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/o3nes3sbk8zf1.png?width=1440&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=84f080c9ebfa1b3202001242174549236bc8f83d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similar to Unsloth’s GPU memory-reduction capability, LLaMa-Factory integrated with KTransformers can, when VRAM is still insufficient, leverage CPU/AMX-instruction compute for CPU-GPU heterogeneous fine-tuning, achieving the dramatic drop in VRAM demand shown below. With just one server plus two RTX 4090s, you can now fine-tune DeepSeek 671B locally!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/u7yqc13fk8zf1.png?width=1136&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5ede3dcf8eb95134929b452b67bc76dfeb8e8730"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/u7yqc13fk8zf1.png?width=1136&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5ede3dcf8eb95134929b452b67bc76dfeb8e8730&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/nekofneko"&gt; /u/nekofneko &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oo62ww/ktransformers_open_source_new_era_local/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oo62ww/ktransformers_open_source_new_era_local/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My comments first:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/IpMMPxE"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/IpMMPxE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kimi Linear once again showed stronger RULER scores in their paper with lower longbenchv2 scores. The problem which I complained about here: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nfyjv5/cmv_qwen3next_is_an_architectural_deadend_much/"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nfyjv5/cmv_qwen3next_is_an_architectural_deadend_much/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's disastrous! Of the evals in that image, only LongBenchv2 is remotely similar to real world tests like Fiction.liveBench and it's the only one that's lower. Once again they are being misled by bad evals that will take you into the wrong direction. Multi-hop reasoning is EVERYTHING in real world agents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking on X currently the new minimax is getting a lot of hype as the new hotness while kimi linear is already getting forgotten as far as I can tell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MiniMax M2 Tech Blog 3: Why Did M2 End Up as a Full Attention Model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On behave of pre-training lead Haohai Sun. (&lt;a href="https://zhihu.com/question/1965302088260104295/answer/1966810157473335067"&gt;https://zhihu.com/question/1965302088260104295/answer/1966810157473335067&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I. Introduction&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the lead of MiniMax-M2 pretrain, I've been getting many queries from the community on &amp;quot;Why did you turn back the clock and go with full attention with MiniMax M2?&amp;quot; After explaining the backstory in one chat after another, I figured it's time to write down our journey in a blog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I could give you the textbook debate. I could talk all afternoon about why you should build linear/sparse attention. Then, I could turn around and talk all afternoon about why you shouldn't. But what's the point of all that hand-waving? The real question is whether you should actually do it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, let's start with the conclusion: We are always working on it. But in a real-world, industrial-grade system, the truth is that efficient attention still has some way to go before it can definitively beat full attention. As LLMs have evolved, the entire stack has become monstrously complex. We serve more scenarios, and the architecture design trade-offs are exploding: &amp;quot;How does it perform on code and math? What about agent scenarios? How does it handle multimodality? Does long-chain CoT still hold up? Can RL scale on top of it? Are there hidden traps with low-precision compute? How do you implement interleaved thinking, caching, or speculative decoding? ... &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, there's a vast difference between the promise on paper and its payoff in production. You only get to claim that payoff after satisfying Condition 1...n and solving Problem 1...n.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;II. Why Efficient Attention?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let's do a thought experiment. If you had infinite compute, would you even bother with linear or sparse attention? Some might bring up theoretical arguments about softmax attention &amp;quot;oversmoothing&amp;quot; in an infinite context... but who knows? Under the current compute bound, no model has truly pushed softmax attention to its absolute limit. So, for all practical purposes, the race for efficient attention is a race to save compute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For our M2 design, could we aim to save tokens — achieving the same quality with fewer tokens? Well if you believe in scaling laws, to achieve this goal, you'd probably bet on other paths to get there, not efficient attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, the simple truth is this: Compute is finite. We need an architecture that makes better use of it — models that achieve higher performance under the same budget (training &amp;amp; inference).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;III. The Real Bottlenecks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To build a model that can practically be deployed and used by the community, we have to start with what users care: Quality, Speed (TPS), and Price. Quality is non-negotiable. A useless model is useless even if it's free. So how do we make a Linear/Sparse/Hybrid Attention model that performs well enough? The biggest challenge here isn’t the architecture design — the real bottleneck is the limitations of evaluation. (As for speed and price, those are heavily influenced by the inference stack—and great models tend to attract great engineers to optimize them.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Evaluation Trap: Goodhart's Law in Action&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As long as you build the benchmark, I’ll find a way to beat it.” Over the past few years of LLM development, the pace of leaderboard progress is staggering. No matter how hard a benchmark is — even if the SOTA score starts in single digits — once it catches the industry’s attention, it’s usually crushed within a few iterations. But how do you build an evaluation system that is comprehensive and actually reflects a model's true capabilities? That’s one of the hardest — and most critical — problems in LLM development, and it becomes even more acute when you start messing with a component as fundamental as attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Benchmarks are a Leaky Abstraction&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s no free lunch. When you reduce the complexity of attention, you pay a price. The question is, where?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we were developing MiniMax-Text-01, everyone was still evaluating MMLU, BBH, MATH, and LongBench (all of which are now saturated). From the perspective of a year ago, a hybrid of Lightning Attention and Full Attention looked just as good as pure full attention. Our own small-scale hybrid models confirmed this on the leaderboards. (Did we find a free lunch?)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not quite. The price paid became obvious at a larger scale: the model had clear deficits in complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, once a problem is exposed, you can fix it. We developed proxy metrics for this specific weakness and iterated until the hybrid model seemed to match MHA. But does that proxy metric still correlate with real-world downstream performance at an even larger scale? Are there other hidden weaknesses? Who knows. We haven't run those experiments yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The better the models get, the harder they are to evaluate. But that’s a must part of the journey — keep it up, eval teams!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The High Cost of Knowing Things&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For complex reasoning tasks, we can sometimes find early proxy metrics that correlate well with final performance — but not for all tasks (at least, not yet). As tasks get harder, the amount of experiment compute required just to get a statistically significant signal on your metric grows astronomically — which is ironic, since we study efficient attention because compute is limited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And beyond the academic benchmarks, optimization issues often only surface at scale. You never really know what’s going to happen until you scale up. Anyone who read our M1 paper will recall the serious precision issues we hit during RL training — problems that would’ve been spotted earlier. Going back and analyzing Lightning Attention's numerical convergence with that experience in hand was incredibly clarifying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Discovering the real problems is often far harder than solving them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Symphony of Variables&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are just too many variables in model training. Different architectures behave very differently on different data distributions and with different optimizers. In a world where our data is constantly being updated, an experiment run on last month's data mix might yield the opposite conclusion today. We can’t observe everything perfectly — but we’re working on finding more reliable experimental strategies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infrastructure: Where Theory Meets Metal&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared to full attention, the infrastructure for linear and sparse attention is much less mature. To actually get the promised results, there’s still a lot of groundwork to fill in. Take linear attention for example: If you analyze the compute intensity of existing linear architectures, many of them are memory-bound — even during training. Without extreme IO optimization, you’re basically leaving a huge amount of GPU FLOPs on the table. And inference brings even more challenges than training: How do you deliver a service that is genuinely faster and cheaper? Linear attention has linear compute complexity and constant memory usage. That means there’s a crossover point where it becomes more efficient than full attention in compute and memory. In theory, that point lies at a few thousand tokens — which isn’t particularly long for today’s large models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that’s just theory. We need to solve a few key problems to actually approach it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Low-Precision State Storage: Linear attention is currently far more sensitive to numerical precision than full attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prefix Caching: In real-world applications, the cache-hit rate for conversations is very high. A new architecture must handle this gracefully.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speculative Decoding: How do you optimize speculative decoding with linear attention backbone? Well fortunately, all of these seem solvable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IV. What’s Next&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scaling remains the name of the game, and context scaling is one of the key problems. Longer and longer context length is key in both pre-training and post-training. As GPU compute growth slows while data length keeps increasing, the benefits of linear and sparse attention will gradually emerge. We should start preparing now:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better Data: More multimodal, information-rich long-context data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better Evaluation: More informative evaluation system and experimental paradigms to speed up iteration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better Infrastructure: Mature training and inference infrastructure to fully squeeze out GPU potential.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;V. Addendum: the SWA code...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We accidentally left the SWA inference code in the open-source release, and some people asked why it wasn’t used in the final model. Simple answer: the performance wasn't good enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That experiment was from quite early on, before GPT-OSS was open-sourced (we were pretty surprised to see its structure, by the way). But I can share a brief summary of our failed attempt. We tried adapting CPT into a Hybrid SWA, testing both inter &amp;amp; intra-layer mixing. The motivation for intra-layer mixing was to balance the compute intensity across all layers, which is friendly to both PP in training and PP or AFD during inference. Unfortunately, neither worked. Performance degraded noticeably as context length grew — which is unacceptable in agentic scenarios.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our analysis showed that many global attention patterns (like retrieval head and induction head) were already established early during pre-training. CPT can hardly adjust those patterns afterwards. You surely can mitigate the issue by using data probes to identify and keep those heads as full attention — but unfortunately, it’s nearly impossible to discover them all from human priors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(And no, this issue isn’t related to attention sinks.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're interested in this line of research, I recommend taking a closer look at GPT-OSS, CWM, and Gemma, especially their long-context performance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, we’re hiring!

What’s a good setup that would allow me to get the “same” or similar experience to having coding agent like Claude code in the terminal running a local model?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What software/models would you suggest I start with. I’m looking for something easy to set up and hit the ground running to increase my productivity and create some side projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: by similar or same experience I mean the CLI experience — not the model it self. I’m sure there’s still a lot of good os models that are solid for a lot of coding tasks. Sure they’re not as good as Claude, but they are not terrible either and a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Mobile_Ice_7346"&gt; /u/Mobile_Ice_7346 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oomisv/what_is_a_good_setup_to_run_claude_code/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oomisv/what_is_a_good_setup_to_run_claude_code/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was trying to analyze a complex social situation as well as my own behavior objectively. The models tended to say I did the right thing, but I thought it may have been biased.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, in a new conversation, I just rephrased it pretending to be the person I perceived to be the offender, and asked about &amp;quot;that other guy's&amp;quot; behavior (actually mine) and what he should have done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I find this funny, since it forces you to empathize as well when reframing the prompt from the other person's point of view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Local models are particularly useful for this, since you completely control their memory, as remote AIs could connect the dots between questions and support your original point of view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/autoencoder"&gt; /u/autoencoder &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oohhkr/how_to_turn_a_models_sycophancy_against_itself/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oohhkr/how_to_turn_a_models_sycophancy_against_itself/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

In this post I would like share empircal measurements, where I think those numbers come from, and make the case that few people should be purchasing this system. I hope you find it helpful!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Model under test&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;llama.cpp&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Gpt-oss-120b&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;One the highest quality models that can run on mid range hardware. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Total size for this model is ~59GB and ~57GB of that are expert layers.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Systems under test&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First system:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;128GB Strix Halo&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Quad channel LDDR5-8000&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second System (my system):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dual channel DDR5-6000 + pcie5 x16 + an rtx 5090&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;An rtx 5090 with the largest context size requires about 2/3 of the experts (38GB of data) to live in system RAM.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;cuda backed&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;mmap off&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;batch 4096&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ubatch 4096&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are user submitted numbers for the Strix Halo:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;test&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;t/s&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;pp4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;997.70 ± 0.98&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;tg128&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;46.18 ± 0.00&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;pp4096 @ d20000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;364.25 ± 0.82&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;tg128 @ d20000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;18.16 ± 0.00&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;pp4096 @ d48000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;183.86 ± 0.41&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;tg128 @ d48000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;10.80 ± 0.00&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can we learn from this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Performance is acceptable only at context 0. As context grows performance drops off a cliff for both prefill and decode.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here are numbers from my system:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;test&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;t/s&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;pp4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;4065.77 ± 25.95&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;tg128&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;39.35 ± 0.05&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;pp4096 @ d20000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;3267.95 ± 27.74&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;tg128 @ d20000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;36.96 ± 0.24&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;pp4096 @ d48000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;2497.25 ± 66.31&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;tg128 @ d48000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;35.18 ± 0.62&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait a second, how are the decode numbers so close at context 0? The strix Halo has memory that is 2.5x faster than my system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let's look closer at gpt-oss-120b. This model is 59 GB in size. There is roughly 0.76GB of layer data that is read for every single token. Since &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; token needs this data, it is kept in VRAM. Each token also needs to read 4 arbitrary experts which is an additional 1.78 GB. Considering we can fit 1/3 of the experts in VRAM, this brings the total split to 1.35GB in VRAM and 1.18GB in system RAM at context 0.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now VRAM on a 5090 is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; faster than both the Strix Halo unified memory and also dual channel DDR5-6000. When all is said and done, doing ~53% of your reads in ultra fast VRAM and 47% of your reads in somewhat slow system RAM, the decode time is roughly equal (a touch slower) than doing all your reads in Strix Halo's moderately fast memory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why does the Strix Halo have such a large slowdown in decode with large context?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's because when your context size grows, decode must also read the KV Cache once per layer. At 20k context, that is an extra ~4GB per token that needs to be read! Simple math (2.54 / 6.54) shows it should be run 0.38x as fast as context 0, and is almost exactly what we see in the chart above.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;And why does my system have a large lead in decode at larger context sizes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's because all the KV Cache is stored in VRAM, which has ultra fast memory read. The decode time is dominated by the slow memory read in system RAM, so this barely moves the needle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do prefill times degrade so quickly on the Strix Halo?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good question! I would love to know!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can I just add a GPU to the Strix Halo machine to improve my prefill?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately not. The ability to leverage a GPU to improve prefill times depends heavily on the pcie bandwidth and the Strix Halo only offers pcie x4.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real world measurements of the effect of pcie bandwidth on prefill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These tests were performed by changing BIOS settings on my machine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;config&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;prefill tps&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;pcie5 x16&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;~4100&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;pcie4 x16&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;~2700&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;pcie4 x4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;~1000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is pci bandwidth so important?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is my best high level understanding of what llama.cpp does with a gpu + cpu moe:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;First it runs the router on all 4096 tokens to determine what experts it needs for each token.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Each token will use 4 of 128 experts, so on average each expert will map to 128 tokens (4096 * 4 / 128).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Then for each expert, upload the weights to the GPU and run on all tokens that need that expert.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;This is well worth it because prefill is compute intensive and just running it on the CPU is much slower.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;This process is pipelined: you upload the weights for the next token, when running compute for the current.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Now all experts for gpt-oss-120b is ~57GB. That will take ~0.9s to upload using pcie5 x16 at its maximum 64GB/s. That places a ceiling in pp of ~4600tps.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;For pcie4 x16 you will only get 32GB/s, so your maximum is ~2300tps. For pcie4 x4 like the Strix Halo via occulink, its 1/4 of this number.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;In practice neither will get their full bandwidth, but the absolute ratios hold.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other benefits of a normal computer with a rtx 5090&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Better cooling&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Higher quality case&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A 5090 will almost certainly have higher resale value than a Strix Halo machine&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;More extensible&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;More powerful CPU&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Top tier gaming&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Models that fit entirely in VRAM will absolutely &lt;em&gt;fly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Image generation will be much much faster.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is Strix Halo good for&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Extremely low idle power usage&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It's small&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Maybe all you care about is chat bots with close to 0 context&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TLDR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you can afford an extra $1000-1500, you are much better off just building a normal computer with an rtx 5090. The value per dollar is just so much stronger. Even if you don't want to spend that kind of money, you should ask yourself if your use case is actually covered by the Strix Halo. Maybe buy nothing instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corrections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please correct me on anything I got wrong! I am just a novice!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I received a message that maybe llama.cpp + Strix Halo is not (fully?) leveraging it's NPU now, which should improve prefill numbers (but not decode). If anyone knows more about this or has preliminary benchmarks, please share them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Updated numbers from the latest llama someone commented here:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;model&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;size&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;params&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;backend&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;ngl&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;n_batch&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;n_ubatch&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;fa&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;mmap&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;test&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="right"&gt;t/s&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;gpt-oss 120B MXFP4 MoE&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;59.02 GiB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;116.83 B&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;ROCm,Vulkan&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;99&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;pp4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;1012.63 ± 0.63&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;gpt-oss 120B MXFP4 MoE&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;59.02 GiB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;116.83 B&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;ROCm,Vulkan&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;99&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;tg128&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;52.31 ± 0.05&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;gpt-oss 120B MXFP4 MoE&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;59.02 GiB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;116.83 B&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;ROCm,Vulkan&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;99&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;pp4096 @ d20000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;357.27 ± 0.64&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;gpt-oss 120B MXFP4 MoE&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;59.02 GiB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;116.83 B&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;ROCm,Vulkan&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;99&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;tg128 @ d20000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;32.46 ± 0.03&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;gpt-oss 120B MXFP4 MoE&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;59.02 GiB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;116.83 B&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;ROCm,Vulkan&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;99&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;pp4096 @ d48000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;230.60 ± 0.26&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;gpt-oss 120B MXFP4 MoE&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;59.02 GiB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;116.83 B&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;ROCm,Vulkan&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;99&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;4096&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;tg128 @ d48000&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;32.76 ± 0.05&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WOW!
