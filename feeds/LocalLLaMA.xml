They have unstructured data, they know they want a chatbot, their first instinct is to move data from A to B. Then... nothing. Maybe a vector database. That's it. Connecting the dots between ingestion/Indexing and the RAG isn't obvious. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Others have a working RAG setup, but it's not giving them the results they want. Each iteration is painful. The feedback loop is slow. Time to failure is high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pattern I keep seeing: you can build twenty different RAGs and still run into the same problems. If your processing pipeline isn't good, your RAG won't be good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What trips you up most? Is it: - Figuring out what steps are even required - Picking the right tools for your specific data - Trying to effectively work with those tools amongst the complexity - Debugging why retrieval quality sucks - Something else entirely&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curious what others are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/OnyxProyectoUno"&gt; /u/OnyxProyectoUno &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ph3h4j/where_do_you_get_stuck_when_building_rag_pipelines/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ph3h4j/where_do_you_get_stuck_when_building_rag_pipelines/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was bored browsing this sub, and found a barely-upvoted thread about Hermes 4.3 36B. I don't care about the model (I never bother with finetunes + I can't run a dense 36B anyway), but buried in there was a very interesting piece of information: this model was trained entirely in a decentralized way on consumer hardware. Supposedly the largest model ever trained in a decentralized manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TLDR: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;They created a tool called Psyche (open-source) to split training across multiple remote GPUs. GPUs can join and leave the swarm in the middle of a training run. Training can be paused/resumed. One of its design goals was to maximize savings by letting you train on rented GPUs during offhours. They also use some sort of blockchain bullshit, I think it's to make sure a rented GPU can't poison their training by submitting fake results.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They also trained a 2nd copy of the model the classic way, on a single cluster of GPUs, and got comparable or better result on the version trained decentralized. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their blog post where they discuss Psyche vs Centralized release: &lt;a href="https://nousresearch.com/introducing-hermes-4-3/"&gt;https://nousresearch.com/introducing-hermes-4-3/&lt;/a&gt; You can see the status web UI of Psyche here: &lt;a href="https://psyche.network/runs"&gt;https://psyche.network/runs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's a few questionable things that tempered my excitement:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;This may be hard to answer given the heterogenous nature of Psyche training, but there's no estimates of how much &amp;quot;efficiency&amp;quot; may be lost training the same model in Psyche vs centralized. No mention of how many rejections they had to do. It's likely they didn't record those things.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The big one: why would the Psyche version of 4.3 get better benchmarks than Centralized 4.3? They just mention it like it's an exciting news and don't address it again, but a normal reader would expect both models to have similar benchmark results, and therefore any significant difference is sus.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I wanted to ask the above questions on their Discord before posting here, but it has a buggy verification bot that asks you to enter numbers that are not there on the test image. It almost made me not want to submit this post, because if their Discord bot is this shitty, that reflects badly on their other tools.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'd love to hear what people who do training think of Psyche. Is it a huge deal?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/dtdisapointingresult"&gt; /u/dtdisapointingresult &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pglclf/thoughts_on_decentralized_training_with_psyche/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pglclf/thoughts_on_decentralized_training_with_psyche/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>What are the cons of MXFP4?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that we can make the model FP16 and fine-tune it and then quantize to MXFP4 again,and the model will be robust because it was trained with QAT,what would be the cons? MXFP4 is (almost) virtually lossless,not FP16 but near-lossless,and it cuts training cost into the half compared to FP16? (FP8 won't be exactly the half because some layers will be kept in FP16 or FP32,so usually like 30% less) while MXFP4 still uses layers that are in higher precision the MoE layers are almost always in 4-bit and that's where the bulk of the computation go,so why it's not the new route? Especially it's standardized so it's verified to be in production and we have seen that with GPT-OSS,I found that MXFP4 gets much less loss even when they get upscaled to FP16 and then quantized to something like INT4 (which has wide compatibility with all types of hardware) compared to model that are trained in FP16.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pgoezb/what_are_the_cons_of_mxfp4/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pgoezb/what_are_the_cons_of_mxfp4/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

But they use the power from the charger directly, instead of going through the battery, saving heat, battery cycles/wear and keeping the performance fast and the phone cooler. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've also got a BodyGuardz Paradigm Pro case for my s25ultra, with better cooling than 99% of cases while protecting.

    <title>Does the "less is more" principle apply to AI agents?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm sketching out an idea for a project. I'm wrestling with this idea: whether &amp;quot;less is more&amp;quot; applies to AI agents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You see all these demos with agents that can browse the web, use tools, call functions, and all that. But my gut reaction is that it's all function and games until an agent decides to call some tool it doesn't need, poisons its context with irrelevant info, and makes the final output worse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is making me lean into constraining the agents for my project. I'm documenting my thinking &lt;a href="https://github.com/8ta4/spam/blob/7f94d397f7777c2f3fdeb557366642f07d7947eb/DONTREADME.md"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don't search the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don't call functions to get more data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each agent has just one job, so a &lt;code&gt;judge&lt;/code&gt; agent only judges and doesn't edit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel like this will make the whole system more predictable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then I can't shake the feeling that this is a shortsighted move. I worry I'm building something that's going to be obsolete the moment a smarter model drops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With how fast everything is moving, is this constrained approach a form of premature optimization?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/8ta4"&gt; /u/8ta4 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pgxftt/does_the_less_is_more_principle_apply_to_ai_agents/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pgxftt/does_the_less_is_more_principle_apply_to_ai_agents/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Here's a quick follow-up on testing that (more details + repro steps &lt;a href="https://github.com/okuvshynov/golem?tab=readme-ov-file"&gt;on github&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coverage of expert activation per layer for two different prompts looks like this (short prompts, 512 tokens generated)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/q69bfynq2w5g1.png?width=2100&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=09a63ab5f52b1ce41acfb0f217afb1d27173fa84"&gt;Qwen3-235b (6bit, 128 experts total, 8/token)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/5jso00333w5g1.png?width=2100&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9eb6cda756742e903169567a6734b29d45e066f9"&gt;GLM 4.6 (4 bit, 160 experts total, 8/token)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Storing a static set of experts/layer will be suboptimal, but we can get some initial seed + implement reasonable allocation/eviction policies and run models which would not fit into fast memory otherwise. Looking at these charts, we can see that first layers and few last layers are more diverse, while the middle part is more likely to benefit from partial allocation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's practical result of running Qwen3-235B @Q6 on M2 Ultra (192GB).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With warm start on some aggregated frequently used expert set, for short prompt + 512 tokens generated, we get hit rate which looks like this, depending on cache size per layer:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/he329uhi4w5g1.png?width=1800&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d18b4c049466618f4abf7079b25c61994934a894"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/he329uhi4w5g1.png?width=1800&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d18b4c049466618f4abf7079b25c61994934a894&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A reasonable thing to do would be to just store less-cacheable layers fully, and be more aggressive in caching the middle layers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We can make some comparison with t/s for 4bit version, which fits into unified memory:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4bit baseline, model in unified memory:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;% mlx_lm.generate --model mlx-community/Qwen3-235B-A22B-4bit-DWQ -p &amp;quot;Write 5 poems about the ocean in different styles&amp;quot; -m 512 ... ========== Prompt: 18 tokens, 48.314 tokens-per-sec Generation: 512 tokens, 28.679 tokens-per-sec Peak memory: 132.397 GB &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;6bit with 96 (out of 128) experts:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;% python scripts/generate.py -m ~/projects/llms/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-6bit -c 96 -p &amp;quot;Write 5 poems about the ocean in different styles&amp;quot; -n 512 -W /tmp/qwen235-6b ...

Generation: 512 tokens, 14.6 t/s &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is more information in the repo (including longer prompts, known inefficiencies, etc), but some conclusions:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;it's definitely feasible for models which are 'slightly not fitting' for personal usage, where we don't care much about multi-query throughput; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;it should work better when secondary memory is faster (say, RAM -&amp;gt; PCIe -&amp;gt; VRAM)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;in this experiment, we were bringing experts to fast memory/compute. On different hardware the alternative could be to just decide to keep less frequently experts on slower memory/compute, with periodic prompt-specific reallocation not on critical path. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;we can speculatively prefetch experts a few layers in advance and amortize the cost. Current experimental implementation is suboptimal and fetching experts right when we need them, blocking the compute.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/zqkb"&gt; /u/zqkb &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ph14do/dynamic_allocation_of_less_used_experts_to_slower/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ph14do/dynamic_allocation_of_less_used_experts_to_slower/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

I've done slight adjustment to close the tags properly and ensure all other blocks are also closed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; REASONING Enable deep thinking subroutine. You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside &amp;lt;thinking&amp;gt;thinking&amp;lt;/thinking&amp;gt; tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. Enclose code blocks with triple back ticks. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;The model seems to be doing ok in small refactors in NextJS, where GPT-OSS-120B and Devstral Small 1.1 2507 succeeds in a single shot in one of my repos. However, it loops reading in larger jobs - will wait tomorrow to check if thinking tags help that or is flop. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Holiday_Purpose_3166"&gt; /u/Holiday_Purpose_3166 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pgnj1q/aquif_35_max_1205_42ba3b/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pgnj1q/aquif_35_max_1205_42ba3b/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>
