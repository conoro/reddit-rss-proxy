I built &lt;a href="https://reasonscape.com/"&gt;ReasonScape&lt;/a&gt; to be different, lets see what it tells us about how AI21's latest drop compared to the high quality 4B we know and love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My usual disclaimer is that these are all &lt;a href="https://github.com/the-crypt-keeper/reasonscape/blob/develop/docs/tasks.md"&gt;information processing tasks&lt;/a&gt; so I make no claims of performance on summarization, creative writing or similar tasks. This evaluation is a counting letters, tracking objects, doing math, following instructions kinda thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second disclaimer is that I am sharing data from my &lt;a href="https://github.com/the-crypt-keeper/reasonscape/tree/develop"&gt;development branch&lt;/a&gt; that's not yet been published to the leaderboard or explorer apps - working on it, aiming for this weekend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Caveats aside lets start with high-level views:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/7rrhce1au3uf1.png?width=1349&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f4abfa1cbcca3c2e5b4931e8c8492be6bc3d10fe"&gt;Overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In terms of average tokens, this model sits somewhere between the OG and 2507-Thinking. Performance was incredibly weak outside of 2 domains: Cars (&lt;a href="https://github.com/the-crypt-keeper/reasonscape/blob/develop/docs/tasks/cars.md"&gt;Spatial state tracking&lt;/a&gt;) and Dates (&lt;a href="https://github.com/the-crypt-keeper/reasonscape/blob/develop/docs/tasks/dates.md"&gt;Time operations&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reasonscape &lt;a href="https://github.com/the-crypt-keeper/reasonscape/blob/develop/docs/methodology.md"&gt;methodology &lt;/a&gt;requires me to run &lt;strong&gt;*a lot\&lt;/strong&gt;* of tests, but also gives us a way to look deeper inside the performance of each task:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/z50u525o34uf1.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=af5e03a87914f0904ae7d82d2edd2f1cbcb86080"&gt;Task Deep Dive 1: Arithmetic, Boolean, Brackets, Cars, Shuffle, Objects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/8c3i9xcq34uf1.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3f78ed06f64910d1dec0c09ac7284a2cd0e85aeb"&gt;Task Deep Dive 2: Dates, Letters, Movie, Sequence, Shapes, Sort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The original Qwen3-4B was a really strong model, the 2507 release that split it into two halves was a mixed bag - the resulting Thinking model is quite good but it does not universally outperform the OG, &lt;a href="https://github.com/the-crypt-keeper/reasonscape/blob/develop/docs/tasks/sequence.md"&gt;Sequence &lt;/a&gt;is an example of a task the 2507 regressed on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before final thoughts, lets directly compare Jamba to the OG Qwen3-4B across the gamut of tasks:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/lpkrxumi44uf1.png?width=857&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=37102fa70a4780f987d27ec56a0eefbae349562c"&gt;Bar Plot: Jamba Reasoning 3B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/v2n3y3zn44uf1.png?width=854&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5c2bf95b75862dde463664a92ad223e961d9891b"&gt;Bar Plot: Qwen3-4B OG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it's fair to say that task-performance of Jamba Reasoning 3B leaves much to be desired. &lt;a href="https://github.com/the-crypt-keeper/reasonscape/blob/develop/docs/tasks/letters.md"&gt;Letters &lt;/a&gt;is a parametric version the 'count rs in strawberry' tests and for a native-thinking model to fail it this hard is pretty embarassing imo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The glaring problem with this model is &lt;strong&gt;truncation&lt;/strong&gt;. All these evaluations were run at &lt;strong&gt;8K context&lt;/strong&gt;, so naively you'd think truncation means the model is just running out of tokens but this is absolutely not the case - if you look at Dates for example all successfull responces are ~2K but truncation rate is still a crazy ~10% the just model loses its mind:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;We need to parse the problem: &amp;quot;Given a small set of sentences about a particular date, answer the provided question. Respond only with the final date in MM/DD/DD/YYYY[*six thousand more Y*] We need to find today's date given that Xavier moved to the city on 04/11/2023, and 299 days have passed since then. So we need to add 299 days to 04/11/2023.\n\nWe need to compute the date.\n\nLet's do step by step.\n\nStart date: April 11, 2023.\n\nAdd 299 days.\n\nWe can break into years, months, days.\n\nFirst, add full years. Since 299 days is less than a year, we can approximate.\n\nBut we need to be precise.\n\nWe can use a date calculator approach.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nApril 11, 2023 + 299 days.\n\nWe can add month by month, but need to account for days.\n\nLet's do it systematically.\n\nWe can use a date addition: 299 days from April 11, 2023.\n\nWe can break into quarters maybe.\n\nBut maybe easier: compute month by month.\n\nWe can start from April 11, 2023.\n\nAdd 30 days to get May 11, 2023.\n\nAdd another 30 days: June 11, 2023.\n\nAdd another 30 days: July 11, 2023.\n\nAdd another 30 days: August 11, 2023.\n\nAdd another 30 days: September 11, 2023.\n\nAdd another 30 days: October 11, 2023.\n\nAdd another 30 days: November 11, 2023.\n\nWait, but we only have 299 days. Let's see.\n\nWe can count the days month by month.\n\nFrom April 11 to next April 11 is 365 days? But we only add 299 days.\n\nLet's do a more precise method.\n\nWe can use the fact that 299 days from April 11, 2023.\n\nWe can compute by adding days month by month.\n\nApril 11, 2023 + 299 days.\n\nWe can break into months:\n\n- April: 30 days (from April 11 to April 30). That's 19 days? Wait, from April 11 to May 11 is 30 days? Let's do step by step.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can use a date calculator logic.\n\nLet's use a simpler approach: add 299 days to April 11, 2023.\n\nWe can use the fact that 2023 is not a leap year (2023 is not divisible by 4). So February has 28 days.\n\nWe can use a date addition.\n\nBut maybe we can use a known method: add 299 days to April 11.\n\nWe can add 365 days to get next year, but we only need 299.\n\nLet's do step by step:\n\nApril 11, 2023.\n\nAdd 1 day: April 12, 2023.\n\nAdd 298 days: we need to add 298 days.\n\nWe can break 298 days into years, months, days.\n\nBut maybe we can use a simpler approach: find the date by adding 299 days to April 11, 2023.\n\nWe can use a date calculator mental.\n\nLet's add 299 days to April 11, 2023.\n\nApril 11 + 299 days.\n\nWe can compute:\n\n- April has 30 days, so adding 30 days would get to May 0? Wait.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is too messy.\n\nLet'solve the date calculation.\nWe need to compute the current date:\nThe task: Given a small set of sentences about a particular date.\n\nThe task:\nPlease write a function that is to\n&amp;lt;think&amp;gt;\nWe need to write a function that returns the\n\nWe need to\n&amp;lt;/think&amp;gt;\n\nWe need to\n\n\n\n&amp;lt;think&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/think&amp;gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&amp;lt;/think&amp;gt;\nWe need to write a small set of the problem.\n\n\n&amp;lt;think&amp;gt;\nWe need to write a function.\n\nWe need to think\n\n&amp;lt;think&amp;gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to think\n\n\n&amp;lt;/think&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/think&amp;gt;\n\n\n&amp;lt;think&amp;gt;\nWe need to start a new task:\n\n\nWe need to start a new task.\n\n\n&amp;lt;think&amp;gt;\n\nWe need to\n\nWe need to start a new start\n\n\n\n\n&amp;lt;/think&amp;gt;\n\nWe need to start new start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&amp;lt;think&amp;gt;\n\nWe need to start a new start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&amp;lt;/think&amp;gt;\n\nWe need to start start to start start start [start repeats 4000 times] &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;I ran all models with &lt;strong&gt;{&amp;quot;temperature&amp;quot;: 0.6, &amp;quot;top_p&amp;quot;: 0.95, &amp;quot;top_k&amp;quot;: 20, &amp;quot;min_p&amp;quot;: 0 }&lt;/strong&gt; which is my standard sampler for reasoning models, perhaps there is a different configuration that works better for Jamba reasoning specifically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/itf6y0k674uf1.png?width=1450&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=972e3d53f7eaa361101ab32a00c11bb257fedd62"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/itf6y0k674uf1.png?width=1450&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=972e3d53f7eaa361101ab32a00c11bb257fedd62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In closing, &lt;strong&gt;I don't believe this model is comparable to Qwen3-4B on practical tasks&lt;/strong&gt;.

    <title>Funny/Humor LLMs</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do LLMs handle humor? From what I understand, they basically learn by guessing what word comes next based on tons of text they’ve seen. Over time, they get better at it by adjusting their internal weights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when you ask them to tell a joke, they can do it because they’ve come across lots of jokes during training. They recognize the usual setups and punchlines. They can even explain why something might be funny, but it feels like they’re mostly repeating patterns instead of actually “getting” the joke. I know this is obvious but that leads me to the actual humor part. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tried an experiment to test that. I gave the model a few jokes that I personally find funny, they weren’t the usual dad jokes or puns, and asked it to explain them. It didn’t really seem to understand why they were funny, so I added my own explanation and then asked it to make new jokes in the same style. What it came up with kind of looked like my sense of humor, but it still felt off. Like it was following the rules but didn’t have any real spark behind it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My guess is that it’s copying the structure of the humor but not the feeling. That makes sense, since it doesn’t really “understand” things like people do. It just works off patterns it’s learned from text.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess what I’m trying to figure out is how I should think about this. Am I understanding it right, or am I missing something important about how these models handle humor?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, my point is that it’s obvious that LLMs aren’t understanding like humans are, everyone on this sub knows that it’s just semantic understanding through multidimensional space. So while it can mimic jokes it’s seen or produce common answers to jokes it’s seen, (from my limited tests), it cannot produce jokes that make me laugh if we give it examples of what I find funny, it mostly takes the examples and produces the underlying structure of the text but the actual essence of what makes it funny disappears. This only happens when I explicitly have it look at the examples I like, and have it create novel humor and my expectation was some form of understanding of why I think it was funny, but it failed. Im not referring to when I make a joke and say it’s funny and then I tell it to disregard the structure and naturally generate humor without pattern, pseudoscience but that seems to work a bit better &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/ionlycreate42"&gt; /u/ionlycreate42 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o2prgn/funnyhumor_llms/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o2prgn/funnyhumor_llms/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

From OpenWebUI’s perspective, it’s just one API to read them all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Best part is that we can swap models around (or tear down vllm, start a new node etc) and they just come and go (in the UI) without restarting (as long as we put them all in Olla's config).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let us know what you think!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/2shanigans"&gt; /u/2shanigans &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/thushan/olla"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o2t72w/olla_v0019_is_out_with_sglang_lemonade_support/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know that moment when your AI app is live and suddenly slows down or costs more than expected? You check the logs and still have no clue what happened. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is exactly why we built OpenLIT Operator. It gives you observability for LLMs and AI agents without touching your code, rebuilding containers, or redeploying. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;✅ Traces every LLM, agent, and tool call automatically&lt;br /&gt; ✅ Shows latency, cost, token usage, and errors&lt;br /&gt; ✅ Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, AgentCore, Ollama, and others&lt;br /&gt; ✅ Connects with OpenTelemetry, Grafana, Jaeger, and Prometheus&lt;br /&gt; ✅ Runs anywhere like Docker, Helm, or Kubernetes &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can set it up once and start seeing everything in a few minutes. It also works with any OpenTelemetry instrumentations like Openinference or anything custom you have. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We just launched it on Product Hunt today 🎉&lt;br /&gt; 👉 &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/openlit?launch=openlit-s-zero-code-llm-observability"&gt;https://www.producthunt.com/products/openlit?launch=openlit-s-zero-code-llm-observability&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Open source repo here:&lt;br /&gt; 🧠 &lt;a href="https://github.com/openlit/openlit"&gt;https://github.com/openlit/openlit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have ever said &amp;quot;I'll add observability later,&amp;quot; this might be the easiest way to start.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/patcher99"&gt; /u/patcher99 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o2ug6s/we_just_launched_observability_for_llms_that/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o2ug6s/we_just_launched_observability_for_llms_that/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Specifically, what's the expected performance of a large (GLM or Qwen235B) model that is split over these two with llama.cpp and RPC?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have prototyped this setup already with 2x 96GB regular PCs/CPUs, it's quite slow but the answers are quite good.

    <title>AMD MI50 32GB better buy than MI100?</title>

While it's still supported by ROCm 7, sooner or later AMD will drop it.. I realize all of this will be irrelevant as tech moves on and both these cards will be considered old relics, but doesn't Vulkan support make the MI50 the better long term buy, for homelabbers at least?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/FriendlyRetriver"&gt; /u/FriendlyRetriver &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o2x0bv/amd_mi50_32gb_better_buy_than_mi100/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o2x0bv/amd_mi50_32gb_better_buy_than_mi100/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

I am integrating GDS (GPU Direct Storage) in ComfyUI. And it's working, if you want to test, just do the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; git clone https://github.com/maifeeulasad/ComfyUI.git cd ComfyUI git checkout offloader-maifee python3 main.py --enable-gds --gds-stats # gds enabled run &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And you no longer need custome offloader, or just be happy with quantized version. Or you don't even have to wait. Just run with GDS enabled flag and we are good to go. Everything will be handled for you. I have already created issue and raised MR, review is going on, hope this gets merged real quick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have some suggestions or feedback, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And thanks to these helpful sub reddits, where I got so many advices, and trust me it was always more than enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enjoy your weekend!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/maifee"&gt; /u/maifee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o2wkyw"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o2wkyw/we_can_now_run_wan_or_any_heavy_models_even_on_a/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>
