    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all. I am currently using various models to build my small projects. I have taken an interest in white hat hacking and bug bounties. Knowing nothing about coding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I ask four smaller models to write small snippets of code, and then they each share their output with each other via agents, and then they can vote on the best one and my program chooses that one. Now I want to be able to feed the final output of the full file from the four agents code added together, with two smarter cloud agents where they will edit the overall file in case putting small snippets together has left errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My asktion is, are coding outputs more accurate from smarter larger models, or using smaller smartish models to form a itty bitty coding committe? Or do you want me to tell you in a few days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Spare_Grape_962"&gt; /u/Spare_Grape_962 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qh213r/model_meshing/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qh213r/model_meshing/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're a small team of systems engineers who've been frustrated with the same problem: wanting to run multiple LLMs Localy (like a 70B chat model, a 7B code model, and a fine-tune) on a single high-end GPU (4090/5090/H100/DGX Spark), but having to wait 60-90 seconds to load/switch each time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We've been prototyping a low-level runtime that uses snapshotting to capture a model's full GPU/RAM state. The idea is to let you &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; a few fully-loaded models and switch between them near-instantly—targeting 2-5 second restores, limited by PCIe bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We're planning to open-source the core engine to build it with the community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before we go further, we want to sanity-check the need and the approach:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this a problem you actively face? Would a 5-second model switcher be valuable for your workflow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would be an absolute must-have feature? (e.g., CLI tool, simple GUI, integration with Ollama/LM Studio?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's a total deal-breaker? (e.g., complexity, storage footprint, specific OS/hardware?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;All thoughts and roasting welcome.

    <title>How good is the approach of using local LLMs for ingesting and extracting data for the creation of knowledge graphs?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys! I am new to the world of knowledge graphs and am very interested in exploring it (though I have a bit of prior experience working with LLMs)! What particularly drives me to knowledge graphs is the possibility of getting them to work with RAGs (which ALSO interest me greatly)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am currently looking at using property graphs (neo4j to be specific) as the 'knowledge base' for RAG implementations since I've read that they're more powerful than the alternative of RDFs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What confuses me is about how one should go about generating the knowledge graph in the first place. neo4j's own blog and various others propose using LLMs to extract the data for you, and construct a JSON/csv-esque format which is then ingested to create the knowledge graph&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously, complexity-wise, the concept of going over data, extracting out entities and relations into such a format isn't something VERY demanding for the capabilities of LLMs, so I figured I'd roll with a local LLM to both reduce costs as well as compute (Since using something as large as GPT 5 feels like overkill). Nvidia's paper on SLMs (Small Language Models) interested me on the prospects of using local smaller-scale LLMs in particular&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Except the issue is that it feels like I am poisoning the well here so to speak? If I have tons of text-based documents as my corpora, won't using LLMs to do the job of data extraction and graph generation have issues?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head, I can think of the following issues:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;The LLM could generate duplicates of entities across documents/chunks (For example, the word &amp;quot;White House&amp;quot; is present in a bunch of various documents in various levels of described detail? The LLM could very well extract out multiple such 'White House' entities. Would happen regardless if I used a powerful model like GPT 5 or a small local LLM&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did have an idea of pre-defining all entity types and relations and forcing the LLM to stick with that, as well do an NLP-based deduplication technique, though I am not sure if it'll work well&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2) The LLM could just up and hallucinate up data. Bad for obvious reasons, since I don't want a garbage in = garbage out problem for the resultant rag&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3) It could just generate wonky results with incorrect 'syntax'. Bad for obvious reasons&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4) Manually extracting data and writing the appropriate CYPHER queries? Yeah, won't work out feasibly&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5) Using an NLP-based entity and relation extractor? Faster and cheaper compute-wise, but the duplication issue still remains. It does solve issue 3)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;6) Now one COULD fine-tune an LLM with few-shot learning to get it to better extract data for a knowledge graph, but it turns into another wild goose hunt of ensuring the fine-tuning process works ATOP ensuring the fine-tuned model works well in practice&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With all these issues comes the extra issue of validating the output graph. Feels like I'm biting off more than I can chew, since all of this is VERY hard to pack into a pipeline unless I make my own bespoke one for the domain I am focusing on. Is there a better way of working with local LLMs for this? Or is there a better approach straight up?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/boombox_8"&gt; /u/boombox_8 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qh5zy5/how_good_is_the_approach_of_using_local_llms_for/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qh5zy5/how_good_is_the_approach_of_using_local_llms_for/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

I’m happy to answer technical questions as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/m9j4c7ud5aeg1.png?width=1020&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6caed0d0b7af9cf0edea8b9471afe3e01d94d625"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/m9j4c7ud5aeg1.png?width=1020&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6caed0d0b7af9cf0edea8b9471afe3e01d94d625&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Nora_ww"&gt; /u/Nora_ww &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qh0abp/we_built_a_small_gpu_platform_and_are_looking_for/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qh0abp/we_built_a_small_gpu_platform_and_are_looking_for/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

The server runs continuously in the background and loads models automatically when they're requested. You no longer have to manually select a model before using it — just point your app at http://localhost:2276/v1 and request any installed model by name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Models also unload automatically when idle (configurable: off, 5m, 15m, 1h), so you're not wasting memory when you're not using them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can see the rest of the changes in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/LlamaBarn/releases"&gt;GitHub releases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Install: &lt;code&gt;brew install --cask llamabarn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would love to hear your feedback!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/erusev_"&gt; /u/erusev_ &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.redd.it/2gia31vxibeg1.png"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qh5yvm/llamabarn_023_tiny_macos_app_for_running_local/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

The main reason for all new hardware is that I received a 50% subsidy/refund from my local municipality for digitalization investments. To qualify for this funding, I had to buy new hardware and build a proper &amp;quot;server-grade&amp;quot; system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My goal was to run large models (120B+) locally for data privacy. With the subsidy in mind, I had a budget of around 10,000€ (pre-refund). I initially considered NVIDIA, but I wanted to maximize VRAM. I decided to go with 4x AMD RDNA4 cards (ASRock R9700) to get 128GB VRAM total and used the rest of the budget for a solid Threadripper platform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hardware Specs:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Total Cost: ~9,800€ (I get ~50% back, so effectively ~4,900€ for me).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;CPU: AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 9955WX (16 Cores) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Mainboard: ASRock WRX90 WS EVO &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;RAM: 128GB DDR5 5600MHz &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;GPU: 4x ASRock Radeon AI PRO R9700 32GB (Total 128GB VRAM) &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Configuration: All cards running at full PCIe 5.0 x16 bandwidth. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Storage: 2x 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;PSU: Seasonic 2200W &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cooling: Alphacool Eisbaer Pro Aurora 360 CPU AIO&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Case: PHANTEKS Enthoo Pro 2 Server&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fans: 11x Arctic P12 Pro&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Benchmark Results&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tested various models ranging from 8B to 230B parameters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Llama.cpp (Focus: Single User Latency) Settings: Flash Attention ON, Batch 2048&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th align="left"&gt;Modell&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="left"&gt;NGL&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="left"&gt;Prompt t/s&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="left"&gt;Gen t/s&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="left"&gt;Größe&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;GLM-4.7-REAP-218B-A32B-Q3_K_M&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;999&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;504.15&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;17.48&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;97.6GB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;GLM-4.7-REAP-218B-A32B-Q4_K_M&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;65&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;428.80&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;9.48&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;123.0GB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;gpt-oss-120b-GGUF&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;999&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;2977.83&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;97.47&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;58.4GB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Q4_K_M&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;999&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;399.03&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;12.66&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;39.6GB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;999&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;3169.16&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;81.01&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;4.6GB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;MiniMax-M2.1-Q4_K_M&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;55&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;668.99&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;34.85&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;128.83 GB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-Q4_K_M&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;999&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;848.68&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;25.14&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;18.5GB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-Q3_K_M&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;999&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;686.45&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;24.45&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;104.7GB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;Side note: I found that with PCIe 5.0, standard Pipeline Parallelism (Layer Split) is significantly faster (~97 t/s) than Tensor Parallelism/Row Split (~67 t/s) for a single user on this setup.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;vLLM (Focus: Throughput) Model: GPT-OSS-120B (bfloat16), TP=4, test for 20 requests&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Total Throughput: ~314 tokens/s (Generation) Prompt Processing: ~5339 tokens/s Single user throughput 50 tokens/s&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I used rocm 7.1.1 for llama.cpp also testet Vulkan but it was worse&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I could do it again, I would have used the budget to buy a single NVIDIA RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell (96GB). Maybe I will, if local AI is going well for my use case, I swap the R9700 with Pro 6000 in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Edit nicer view for the results&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/NunzeCs"&gt; /u/NunzeCs &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qgdb7f"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qgdb7f/4x_amd_r9700_128gb_vram_threadripper_9955wx_build/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

I was lucky to find 3090 cards for around 600 usd, over a period of 3 months and decided to go for it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The RAM was a bit more expensive, but I had 64 bought before the price spiked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to change the case, because I through it’s a high quality case and it would be a shame to toss it. So made the most out of it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specs: * Fractal Define 7 Mid Tower * 3x3090 + 1x3060 (86gb total, but 72gb VRAM main) * 128GB DDR4 (Corsair 4x32) * Corsair HX1500i 1500w (has 7 PCIe power cables) * Vertical mounts are all cheap from AliExpress * ASUS Maximus XII Hero — has only 3x PCIe16x, had to deactivate the 2nd NVMe to use the 3rd PCIe16x in 4x, the 4th GPU (the 3060) is on a riser from a PCIe1x. * For drives, only one NVMe of 1TB works, I also bought 2x2TB SSDs that I tried in RAID but the performance was terrible (and they are limited to 500mb from the SATA interface, which I didn’t know…) so I keep them as 2 drives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Temperatures are holding surprisingly well. The gap between the cards is about the size of an empty PCIe slot, maybe a bit more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Temperature was a big improvement compared to having just 2x3090 stacked without any space between them — the way the motherboard is designed to use them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In terms of performance 3x3090 is great! There are great options in the 60-65gb range with the extra space to 72gb VRAM used for context.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am not using the RAM for anything other than to load models, and the speed is amazing when everything is loaded in VRAM! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Models I started using a lot: * gpt-oss-120b in MXFP4 with 60k context * glm-4.5-air in IQ4_NL with 46k context * qwen3-vl-235b in TQ1_0 (surprisingly good!) * minimax-M2-REAP-139B in Q3_K_S with 40k context&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But still return a lot to old models for context and speed: * devstral-small-2-24 in Q8_0 with 200k context * qwen3-coder in Q8 with 1M (!!) context (using RAM) * qwen3-next-80b in Q6_K with 60k context — still my favourite for general chat, and the Q6 makes me trust it more than Q3-Q4 models&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 3060 on the riser from PCIe1x is very slow at loading the models, however, once it’s loaded it works great! I am using it for image generation and TTS audio generation mostly (for Open WebUI).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also did a lot of testing on using 2x3090 via normal PCIe, with a 3rd card via riser — it works same as normal PCIe! But the loading takes forever (sometimes over 2-3 minutes) and you simply can’t use the RAM for context because of how slow it is — so I am considering the current setup to be “maxed out” because I don’t think adding a 4th 3090 will be useful. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/liviuberechet"&gt; /u/liviuberechet &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qgx83t"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qgx83t/3x3090_3060_in_a_mid_tower_case/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

All the above are running on CUDA 12 llama.cpp via LM Studio (nothing special). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Large models (&amp;gt; 100 B)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All big models run in roughly the same ballpark—about &lt;strong&gt;30 tok/s&lt;/strong&gt; in everyday use. GPT‑OSS‑120 runs a bit faster than the other large models, but the difference is only noticeable on very short answers; you wouldn’t notice it during longer conversations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Qwen3‑VL 235 B (TQ1, 1.66‑bit compression)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was surprised by how usable TQ1_0 turned out to be. In most chat or image‑analysis scenarios it actually feels better than the Qwen3‑VL 30 B model quantised to Q8. I can’t fully explain why, but it seems to anticipate what I’m interested in much more accurately than the 30 B version.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It does show the expected weaknesses of a Q1‑type quantisation. For example, when reading a PDF it misreported some numbers that the Qwen3‑VL 30 B Q8 model got right; nevertheless, the surrounding information was correct despite the typo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The biggest and best models you can run in Q3–Q4 with a decent context window:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(A) REAP Minimax M2&lt;/strong&gt; – 139 B quantised to Q3_K_S, at 42k context. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(B) GLM 4.5 Air&lt;/strong&gt; – 110B quantised to IQ4_NL, supports 46 k context. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both perform great and they will probably become my daily models. Overall GLM-4.5-Air feels slower and dumber than REAP Minimax M2, but I haven't had a lot of time with either of them. I will follow up and edit this if I change my min&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. GPT-OSS-120B&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is still decent and runs fast, but I can't help but feel that it's very dated, and extremely censored (!) For instance try asking: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;What are some some examples of business strategies such as selling eternal youth to woman, or money making ideas to poor people?&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;and you’ll get a response along the lines of: “I’m sorry, but I can’t help with that.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Qwen3 Next 80B&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Runs very slow. Someone suggested the bottleneck might be CUDA and to trying Vulkan instead. However, given the many larger options available, I may drop it, even though it was my favourite model when I ran it on a 48GB (2x3090) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall upgrading from 2x3090 to 3x3090, there are a lot of LLM models that get unlocked with that extra 24GB&lt;/strong&gt;. I would argue feels like a much bigger jump that it was when I moved from 24 to 48GB, and just wanted to share for those of you thinking for making the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PS: I also upgraded my ram from 64GB to 128GB, but I think it might have been for nothing. It helps a bit with loading the model faster, but honstly, I don't think it's worth if when you are running everything on the GPU.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/liviuberechet"&gt; /u/liviuberechet &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.redd.it/85cs39k6daeg1.png"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qh442y/models_that_run_in_72gb_vram_with_context_loaded/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spent way too long optimizing Top-K selection for LLM sampling and finally hit some stupid numbers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; AVX2-optimized batched Top-K that beats PyTorch CPU by 4-20x depending on vocab size. Sometimes competitive with CUDA for small batches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benchmarks (K=50):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Vocab=32K: 0.043ms vs PyTorch's 0.173ms (4x faster)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Vocab=128K: 0.057ms vs PyTorch's 0.777ms (13x faster)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Vocab=256K: 0.079ms vs PyTorch's 1.56ms (20x faster)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Integrated it into llama.cpp and got 63% faster prompt processing on a 120B MoE model (81→142 tokens/sec).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Uses adaptive sampling + AVX2 SIMD + cache-optimized scanning. Has fast paths for sorted/constant inputs.
