    <title>A Farmer Doesn’t Know Coding, But Tries to Build an Executing Engine with LLMs and a Code Interpreter</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translated from Korean. I wrote the original in Korean and translated it myself. Final meaning and responsibility are mine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m a garlic farmer in Korea. When I’m not working in the field, I use AI chat interfaces as my personal lab. I experiment with AIs that have sandboxed code interpreters, and I slowly build scripts that become a kind of “engine.” I don’t start from code. I start by talking to the AI, giving my thoughts and structural ideas first. Using the web tools inside the AI chat, I collect and structure information. Then I run that structured information again inside the code interpreter, and I only take the actual execution results and move forward with explainable analysis (XAI). Through this process, the concepts slowly grow, and step by step I give the AI more concrete direction. You can think of it like this: the LLM and the engine inside the sandboxed code interpreter form an indirect pipeline. User input → web tool search → LLM structures → that result is executed by the code interpreter. This is important for me: this is not an environment where I directly build pipelines with APIs. Everything happens inside the AI chat UI that I use every day. By the way, what I call a “sandboxed code interpreter” has different names depending on company or product (Code Interpreter, Data Analysis / Advanced Data Analysis, Code Execution, etc). But the core meaning is the same: An isolated execution environment where code actually runs inside the chat window (a sandboxed execution environment). And the “engine” I talk about is nothing fancy. It is just Python scripts running inside that sandbox (analysis scripts / verification scripts), and the execution-backed verification loop that repeats again and again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Question of Real Execution The biggest problem in this whole process is very simple: Is the code interpreter in the chat really executing, or not? If it is not actually executing, what comes out is close to hallucination — just simulated text with no real meaning. I have seen this many times: the output looks like execution results, but in reality nothing was executed at all. So the key question becomes only one thing for me: “Is this execution real right now?” In my case, I use reproducible code, like random-number-based checks, and make multiple AIs cross-check each other. Below is the overall flow I use, drawn in a very simple way:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Me (input / thoughts)] | v [Web tool search (optional)] | v [LLM conversation / structuring] | v [Engine: sandboxed Python execution] | v [Execution output] | v [XAI / next direction] | v [Loop repeats]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The point I care about most is here: [Sandboxed Python execution] | +-- (execution is real) | -&amp;gt; reproducible output remains | -&amp;gt; becomes verifiable evidence | +-- (execution is fake) -&amp;gt; hallucinated / simulated text looks like “real output” -&amp;gt; high risk of wrong judgment&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is why I try to confirm, as much as possible, whether execution was real, by using reproducible code and cross-checking across multiple AIs. In the end, I feel that the ability to notice hallucination is also a kind of personal know-how. After many experiences, my conclusion is clear: With only one AI, it is almost impossible to get the result I want. You must cross-check between multiple AIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to say this clearly again: I am just a farmer. I only spend small pieces of time, working together with AIs like this. I don’t know if this method is “correct”, but sometimes meaningful results come out, so I keep using it. As time goes on, it feels more and more refined. Each AI has a different mechanism, so sometimes it is confusing. But I feel that the overall frame does work, especially when multiple AIs respond together in a consistent way. Because this is just a personal experiment, sometimes it makes my head hurt. But at the same time, I get many insights because of the AIs. Especially, I often feel that the diversity of AIs itself creates real effectiveness. What do you think about this way of working? I don’t really know how to code, but I learn by talking with AIs. Since multiple AIs give different opinions, I focus only on direction and intent, and let the AIs handle the experiments. Many times, this gives better results than I expected. When I watch code flowing down on my phone screen, it sometimes feels like watching the code scenes from the movie Matrix. And honestly, that part is fun by itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/amadale"&gt; /u/amadale &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pwwd99/a_farmer_doesnt_know_coding_but_tries_to_build_an/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pwwd99/a_farmer_doesnt_know_coding_but_tries_to_build_an/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>Worth the 5090?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am debating on getting a 5090. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I currently have a 3090 that is actively being used for projects. It is an old 64gb ddr4 system with an i5 cpu and a 750 w psu. So nothing fancy and got it cheap. I have half a set up for a dual 3090 build. The plan was to create a dual or triple 3090 build. I have been collecting parts slowly over time without without over paying for them. I have 3 x 3090, a mobo that has spacing for 2 x 3090 (would need risers for the third 3090), 64 gb of ram ddr4, and a large psu. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have used my single 3090 set up for fine tuning small models. Using lm studio, whisper, rag, and knowledge graphs. I then got into Yolo image training. I have not gotten into gaming but maybe some day. I plan to get back into traing LLMs and playing with them after my Yolo model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really like my single 3090 set up as it does not take up a lot of table space. All of my use cases have fit nicely on a single 3090 card. I think a draw back I noticed was needing to unload and load new models as part of the pipeline. I thought this could be fixed with dual 3090s so one model can live on each card. Also concerned about electrical and needing to put more thought into a build than just plug and play. One thing I wish I had was a faster card, and see that the 5090 is a significant upgrade over 3090. However the 48 vs 32 gb of vram is always nice, but the 16gb difference might not be a game changer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I plan on renting a cloud 5090 to compare my current projects and see some hard numbers for speed up for training LLM models, training my Yolo models and LLM inference speeds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But wht do you all think? If you were me, would finish building the dual 3090 build? Or sell two of the 3090s and put it towards a 5090?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don't see myself really using more than 24 gb of vram, but I also tend to plan projects around the hardware that I have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/fgoricha"&gt; /u/fgoricha &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1px052k/worth_the_5090/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1px052k/worth_the_5090/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need LLM fine tuning experts to help us fine tune models for our customer support automation and honestly it's been way harder than we thought. We've got around 6k training examples from our actual support tickets but our attempts at fine tuning are giving us mixed results that don't really justify the extra cost over just using base models with better prompts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Main issue is we can't figure out if our training data needs better cleaning, if we're setting parameters wrong, or if fine tuning even makes sense for our use case. We need experts who've actually done this before and can tell us straight up what's worth doing versus what's just burning money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Need someone with real production experience, not just people who've read the docs. They should be able to audit our training data, run the fine tuning properly, and actually prove the custom model performs better than our current setup. Initially we shortlisted a few options here and Lexis Solutions seems good based on their LLMs fine-tuning portfolio but wanted to hear from people who've actually hired experts for this kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goal is finalize by the end of holidays. Would definitely appreciate any recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/ricturner"&gt; /u/ricturner &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1px78ty/need_recommendations_llm_finetuning_experts/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1px78ty/need_recommendations_llm_finetuning_experts/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Im unable to selfhost, as i dont want to use small models (sub 100b), and dont have the money, to buy such expensive hardware (i know than you can use some old hardware and build something fancey yourself, but even that is to expensive for me). Im not looking for the cheapest ai provider, but doing something, like renting a gpu also isnt something for me. Privacey and trustworthiness are important to me.

I’ve developed a production-grade transformer training framework supporting &lt;strong&gt;Mixture of Experts (MoE)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Mixture of Depths (MoD)&lt;/strong&gt; architectures with custom CUDA kernels and multi-GPU support, capable of scaling from ~500M to 300B+ parameters. The system handles everything from tokenization to gradient optimization, includes sparse routing mechanisms, memory-efficient data processing, and precision-aware training (FP32/FP16/BF16/experimental FP8).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I’m evaluating:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Training a model from scratch versus using &lt;strong&gt;LoRA/adapters&lt;/strong&gt; on an existing base&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Token-level gating efficiency and routing dynamics for MoE&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Layer-level skipping strategies for MoD and their impact on FLOPs vs quality&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hybrid approaches (MoE + MoD) and tradeoffs in compute vs active parameters&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Scaling experiments and performance considerations for large clusters&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical details:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MoE:&lt;/strong&gt; Top-2 of N experts per token, capacity factors dynamically managed, CUDA-optimized dispatch and combination&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MoD:&lt;/strong&gt; Token-level layer skipping with learnable routing, curriculum for capacity_factor annealing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision:&lt;/strong&gt; Mixed FP16/BF16 by default, with full CUDA acceleration and fallback to PyTorch&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Expert utilization, routing entropy, FLOPs reduction, convergence tracking&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware:&lt;/strong&gt; NVIDIA (Volta→Hopper), Apple Silicon (M1-M4), CPU fallback&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m interested in &lt;strong&gt;practical insights&lt;/strong&gt; from those who have worked on sparse architectures or gating systems:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Full training vs adapter-based approaches for gate models&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience with MoE/MoD hybrid training and capacity tuning&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Scaling considerations, token routing stability, or FLOPs tradeoffs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Common pitfalls or strategies for training large-scale sparse models efficiently&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any benchmarks, strategies, or caveats would be really useful.

Is 'vibe-coding' the ultimate trap?" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just watched &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIoohUmYpGI"&gt;The Infinite Software Crisis – Jake Nations&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube and it got me thinking... the limitations of software development has never been typing speed, but rather our ability to comprehend and design the system correctly in the first place. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights from the talk:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Every developer has shipped code they didn't completely understand. it passed the tests and that was enough validation to deploy it.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hard part is timeless:&lt;/strong&gt; The hard part isn't the mechanics of coding; it's the conceptual difficulty of designing a solution. Every tool, including AI, just makes implementation easier.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI amplifies the problem:&lt;/strong&gt; We can now generate code as fast as we can describe it. The scale is infinite, but our comprehension isn't. The core challenge of understanding &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to build remains.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The real trap we fall into is confusing easy with simple. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy&lt;/strong&gt; is what's within reach. What can you access without effort? Generate it with AI, copy-paste, or install a framework. It's about speed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple&lt;/strong&gt; is about structure. It means one fold, one braid, no entanglement. It requires thought and design.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;LLMs do not understand logic, they merely relate language and substitute those relations as &amp;quot;code&amp;quot;, so the importance of &lt;em&gt;patterns and architectural decisions&lt;/em&gt; in your codebase are lost. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;when &amp;quot;vibe-coding&amp;quot; technical debt doesn't register as debt; it's just more code to preserve. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The result? Complex, highly-coupled, and error-prone code generated in minutes that could take you weeks to understand (if ever).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The real danger here is that we're accumulating complexity faster than we can comprehend it because we're not doing the hard work of understanding our systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The proposed solution: SLOW DOWN, DO EVERYTHING MANUALLY; architectural design + scaffolding, etc and only let the LLM in at the last step of filling in the scaffolding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What's your take, Is 'vibe-coding' a trap, or is there a way to use these tools without losing the ability to understand our systems? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/c4mknoudlq9g1.png?width=553&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=28a6f37623fb0e0725f5b603f4b3a8ce51653ac9"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/c4mknoudlq9g1.png?width=553&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=28a6f37623fb0e0725f5b603f4b3a8ce51653ac9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/madSaiyanUltra_9789"&gt; /u/madSaiyanUltra_9789 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pwwsag/the_infinite_software_crisis_were_generating/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pwwsag/the_infinite_software_crisis_were_generating/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Year end thread for the best LLMs of 2025!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2025 is almost done! Its been &lt;strong&gt;a wonderful year&lt;/strong&gt; for us Open/Local AI enthusiasts. And its looking like Xmas time brought some great gifts in the shape of Minimax M2.1 and GLM4.7 that are touting frontier model performance. Are we there already? are we at parity with proprietary models?!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The standard spiel:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Share what your favorite models are right now &lt;strong&gt;and why.&lt;/strong&gt; Given the nature of the beast in evaluating LLMs (untrustworthiness of benchmarks, immature tooling, intrinsic stochasticity), please be as detailed as possible in describing your setup, nature of your usage (how much, personal/professional use), tools/frameworks/prompts etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Only open weights models&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please thread your responses in the top level comments for each Application below to enable readability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt;: Includes practical guidance, how to, encyclopedic QnA, search engine replacement/augmentation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agentic/Agentic Coding/Tool Use/Coding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative Writing/RP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speciality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a category is missing, please create a top level comment under the Speciality comment&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Useful breakdown of how folk are using LLMs: &lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/i8td7u8vcewf1.png?width=1090&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=423fd3fe4cea2b9d78944e521ba8a39794f37c8d"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/i8td7u8vcewf1.png?width=1090&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=423fd3fe4cea2b9d78944e521ba8a39794f37c8d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good suggestion for last time, breakdown/classify your recommendation by model memory footprint: (you can and should be using multiple models in each size range for different tasks)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Unlimited: &amp;gt;128GB VRAM &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Medium: 8 to 128GB VRAM&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Small: &amp;lt;8GB VRAM&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/rm-rf-rm"&gt; /u/rm-rf-rm &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pwh0q9/best_local_llms_2025/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pwh0q9/best_local_llms_2025/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>
