    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wanted to share a side project I've been working on that turned out to be both fascinating and a little alarming. It's called Keyscan, and it's an AI-powered tool I built to scan GitHub Gists for exposed API keys. It uses Ollama under the hood, and you can run the tool on your own devices to search for API keys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea came to me while I was working on another project and was looking at someone's gist. As I was reading the gist, I was struck by a random thought: What would happen if I searched for &lt;code&gt;OPENAI_API_KEY&lt;/code&gt; on GitHub Gists? Would I actually find a real API key?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turns out, yes. On the first page of results was a gist containing a Groq API key. I tested the key using curl, and to my surprise, it was live. I alerted the owner, but the whole experience stuck with me. How many other keys were out there, sitting in public gists?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, a month later, I decided to stop wondering and start building. Over the course of a few days, I put together Keyscan. Keyscan uses a combination of the GitHub Gists API, a local LLM (Ollama), and some custom verification logic to identify and validate exposed API keys. The tool works in roughly three phases:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fetching: Searches Gists for specific keywords and file types, and fetches file contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classification: Preprocesses file contents into lines, and uses an LLM to determine if a line contains an API key and identifies the provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verification: Tests the key against the provider's API to see if it's live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I ran Keyscan on a list of 100 keywords over two days and scanned around 2,500 Gists. In the end, I found over 40 live API keys, including keys for OpenAI, Mistral, Gemini, Groq, and much more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the most ridiculous finds was a .env file where someone asked Claude to collate all their API keys and then uploaded the file to Gists. Yes, most of the keys were live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you would like to read more about Keyscan and my findings, do check out my Medium article.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://liaogg.medium.com/keyscan-eaa3259ba510"&gt;https://liaogg.medium.com/keyscan-eaa3259ba510&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keyscan is also completely open source on GitHub. I'm also looking for contributors who can help expand the current file type modules. Here is the link:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think about my project! I'd love to hear your feedback or ideas for improving Keyscan.

    <title>Local Inference for Very Large Models - a Look at Current Options</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all. I've been considering upgrading my hardware to run larger models locally, and thought I might get some thoughts from the community. &lt;em&gt;Fair warning - this is a bit of a hardware rant&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, I'm running 2 x 3090 (48GB VRAM), and hence using EXL2/3 quants of ~70B models quite happily. They are leagues ahead of where the SOTA was a couple of years ago, and they fulfill most general use cases quite well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That being said, there are increasingly larger and more capable MoE models releasing with open weights. Deepseek R1/V3 (671B32A), Kimi K2 (1000B/1T32A), GLM 4.5 (355B32A), Qwen 3 (235B22A)... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being on a consumer board with an AM4 chip and DDR4 memory, going with GGUF/hybrid inference completely tanks my TG speeds. Therefore, I find myself looking at solutions to run these very large MoE models locally, and none of them seem particularly appealing: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Simply add more 3090's:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The VRAM price-to-performance ratio on these cards is unmatched, and they remain a mainstay for inference long after the 4090 and 5090 have released. Running two of these myself, I'm very happy with them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there are limitations to simply adding more and more 3090's. For one, at 24GB per card, one simply runs out of PCIe lanes on a consumer board. Yes, you could run Oculink and bifurcate with a lot of risers, but let's do the math here; a Q_4_K_M quant of Deepseek R1 comes in at 404GB for the weights alone. That's roughly 404 / 24 = 16.833..., or approximately 17 cards &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; considering context, display output, embedding models, etc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even with a 2.22-bit dynamic quant from Unsloth, that's 183 / 24 = 7.625, so eight cards plus context and system overhead. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I mean, I could bifurcate, but I do think that's pushing it on an AM4 board. Even on something like the latest Threadripper Pro boards, you'd still be looking at bifurcation to fit enough cards for any reasonable quant. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is before considering the other big issue - power consumption. Sure, PCIe bandwidth doesn't matter much for inference once the model is loaded, so bifurcation is no big deal. But 17+ cards on a single machine? Yes, the cards can be power limited to ~150W/card without impacting inference speed much, but that's still 17 x 150 = 2550W at &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The power efficiency does not scale with these cards as we go into higher VRAM ranges, and physically interfacing enough cards becomes an issue. Otherwise, they're great. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Go&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;with a server motherboard, add fast multi-channel RAM, and run hybrid inference:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This seems like the most sane of the options. Granted, I'm not too knowledgeable about workstation/server hardware, so perhaps some better informed individuals could chime in here. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Assuming that multi-channel DDR5 memory is a priority for running MoE, something like the latest gen EPYC processors appear to meet the criteria; 12-channel DDR5, 128 PCIe 5.0 lanes, and plenty of memory capacity. Per-socket memory bandwidth is fairly reasonable on these, as well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My concerns with hybrid inference are prompt processing speeds (I've heard that they can be slower, although it's difficult to get a hold of actual benchmark examples for specific configurations), cost of the system (the chips themselves are costly, and the board and memory are not cheap, either), and the fact that this all still requires some degree of GPU acceleration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I suppose I just don't know enough about what to look for when it comes to server hardware. Memory bandwidth is a priority, but does the core/thread count and clock speed matter much for hybrid inference? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the EPYC 9000-series chips are surprisingly well-priced relative to the memory and PCIe lanes offered, whereas they also go up to $10K without any notable increase in these areas. Surely I'm missing something here, and input would be appreciated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, even with MoE models and selective management of experts, GPU acceleration is needed for acceptable TG speeds, which brings me to my next option. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Get GPUs with more VRAM per Card:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So this would be something like the RTX 6000 Ada, RTX 6000 Pro (Blackwell), and so on. They're fast, have lots of VRAM, and are more power-efficient for inference purposes, where one is memory-bound as opposed to compute-bound (in a local enthusiast context, that is). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The RTX 6000 Pro in particular is appealing. 96GB of GDDR7 VRAM with a 512-bit memory bus means something around ~1.8 TB/s of memory bandwidth. Dual-slot form factor and 600W comes out to about the same power usage as power-limited 3090s for equivalent VRAM &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; any power limiting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Great option, then. Just get a few of these, right? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's $9K per card, which comes out to around $93.75/GB of VRAM, whereas a used 3090 at $600 comes out to $25/GB. Yes, it's faster, and also dodges some of the aforementioned issues with having an entire rack of 3090s, but that's still quite a high premium to be paying - nearly 4x the cost on a per-GB basis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I suppose the other option would be something like multiple modded 48GB 4090Ds from China, which I see are available for 23,000 HKD, or ~$3K. Apparently the VBIOS works with stock Nvidia firmware, but at this price ($62.5/GB) and a 384-bit memory bus, just like a 3090, I don't see much of an argument for these aside from the potential energy savings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the ideal solution is to just stuff 4+ RTX 6000 Pros into an EPYC server, but that would be extremely costly... After doing the breakdown on these, I do see why people still opt for power-limited 3090s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. M3 Ultra w/ 512GB unified memory:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This brings me to a - relatively - more budget-friendly option; an Apple Mac Studio with an M3 Ultra maxed out at 512GB unified memory comes in at around $10K, and would be able to fit R1 at 4-bits. The cost/memory ratio here is only barely matched by the 3090s ($600 x 17 = $10,200), and this is before considering a host system to house so many GPUs. The power efficiency is also significantly better. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The limitations are that TTFT (Time to First Token) is abysmal on these systems, the ecosystem for MLX and Metal are lacking in comparison to CUDA, and the machine is not modifiable or expandable in the future. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This option is appealing, if for no other reason than the fact that it is likely to cause the least headaches and work straight out of the box. That being said, my current machine is a water-cooled frankenstein of a PC, so the fact that I can't slot in an extra NVMe drive into a machine that costs $10K is a bit off-putting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've also only seen a few users reporting their experiences with Apple silicon, and it appears to be quite slow when the context fills up. Combine this with the fact that I prefer Linux, and have grown used to working with Nvidia-compatible back ends, and it looks like a bit of a band-aid fix and a dead end. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If anyone here is running maxed out M-series chips with any success, I'd love to hear how it's going for you. It's an elegant option, if somewhat limited in future scope. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Give up local inference, and just rent on the cloud:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this talk of ten-thousand dollar hardware and a dozen graphic cards makes me think of the ongoing electricity bill, which does beg the question - why not just go with a cloud rental/API? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The economics are undeniably in favor of this option, particular for the largest of the aforementioned models. Host an instance on Runpod and do your inference there, and only pay by the hour. Even better, go with an API provider and pay by the &lt;em&gt;token&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think about how long it would take to even out on a $10K+ machine at the current rates that Deepseek's official API is charging. I mean, how much inference do you perform annually, really?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That being said, this is &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; llama, and I think everyone here prefers to keep their information local and their model under their own control rather than outsourcing to a third party. It may be cost-inefficient, but if it's between paying a subscription and letting all my thoughts/code/documents go through OpenAI/Anthropic/Deepseek servers versus building a ridiculous machine that doubles as a room heater in the winter... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, I may be on the wrong side of history here, but sign me up for the latter. I'm staying local, and I'm willing to spend some cash to do it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So that's been a short overview of the options I see as available for local inference of very large models. Some are more viable than others, some more elegant than others, and some are much more expensive than others. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, if it performs well, then it's good. However, there are multiple ways to go about a task such as this. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone with lots of 3090s, an EPYC board, a maxed out M-series chip, or anything else that can run massive MoE models locally - I'd be interested to hear your thoughts and experiences. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To the community at large, I'd like to hear where people are at with their local inference rigs, and what option here is most future-proof or appealing to you, and for what reasons. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any and all input is welcome. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/HvskyAI"&gt; /u/HvskyAI &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n1h6xx/local_inference_for_very_large_models_a_look_at/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n1h6xx/local_inference_for_very_large_models_a_look_at/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR.&lt;/strong&gt; We introduce &lt;strong&gt;discrete diffusion&lt;/strong&gt; as the action decoder &lt;strong&gt;inside a single transformer&lt;/strong&gt; for VLA. Two simple components—Adaptive decoding order and Secondary re-masking—yield consistent action refinement and outperform AR and continuous-diffusion heads. Trains with the &lt;strong&gt;same cross-entropy objective&lt;/strong&gt; as VLMs, preserving pretrained priors. This design shows better success rates vs AR and continuous diffusion.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Disclosure:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m an author.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s new&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First discrete-diffusion action head for VLA&lt;/strong&gt; (to our knowledge).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-transformer, VLM-style training:&lt;/strong&gt; keeps the discrete token interface and uses the same CE loss as the VLM backbone → &lt;strong&gt;maximizes retention of pretrained VLM priors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive decoding order:&lt;/strong&gt; in each refinement round, we &lt;strong&gt;keep easy tokens first&lt;/strong&gt; via confidence / confidence-gap scores and a cosine keep schedule; the rest remain masked for the next round.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondary re-masking:&lt;/strong&gt; previously kept tokens are &lt;strong&gt;re-checked&lt;/strong&gt; (threshold + residual-drop) and &lt;strong&gt;re-masked&lt;/strong&gt; if uncertain/inconsistent, enabling robust cross-round error correction.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;For robotics manipulation tasks, unlike continuous diffusion decoders, our formulation keeps action generation inside a unified transformer and trains with the same cross-entropy objective used by VLMs. This &lt;strong&gt;preserves the backbone’s pretrained vision-and-language capability&lt;/strong&gt;—akin to extending a vocabulary—while opening a path to &lt;strong&gt;inherit unified transformers’ scaling behavior&lt;/strong&gt;, paving the way for &lt;strong&gt;large-scale VLA&lt;/strong&gt;. Moreover, Discrete Diffusion VLA &lt;strong&gt;breaks the left-to-right bottleneck&lt;/strong&gt; of AR decoders: action chunks are &lt;strong&gt;adaptively decoded in parallel&lt;/strong&gt; over a small, fixed number of steps, and uncertain tokens can be revisited via iterative re-masking, leveraging full cross-modal context (including inter-action dependencies) for refinement.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Paper: &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20072"&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20072&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Demo videos: &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.20072"&gt;https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.20072&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Lonely-Loquat9638"&gt; /u/Lonely-Loquat9638 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n23m90/discrete_diffusion_vla_bringing_discrete/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n23m90/discrete_diffusion_vla_bringing_discrete/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had a hard time getting data scientists and analyst to scale their code in the cloud. Most of the time they’d hand it off to DevOps, which created a massive backlog and DevOps would get spread super thin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I built cluster compute software that lets any Python developer deploy to huge clusters (10k vCPUs, 1k GPUs) with a single function. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget, and responses are fast. You can call a million simple functions in a couple seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/Burla-Cloud/burla"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; and I’m still making install easier, but I also have a few managed versions. If you want to test I'll cover 1,000 CPU and 100 GPU hours.

No matter how complex I make the logic, it still feels like the bot's just fixated on a few words. It's not a fundamental solution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make an AI that thinks like a living organism, I think we need it to recognize &lt;strong&gt;concepts&lt;/strong&gt;, not just keywords.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, instead of treating words like 'travel', 'vacation', and 'flight' as separate things, the bot would group them all into a single &lt;strong&gt;'leisure concept'&lt;/strong&gt; vector. This way, if the conversation shifts from 'plane' to 'hotel', the AI doesn't lose the essence of the conversation because the core concept of 'leisure' is still active.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is roughly how I'd approach the implementation, but has anyone here actually built something like this?

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contextual AI’s reranker v2 is a Qwen3-based multilingual reranker that already behaves like a classifier: the score is the last-token logit for vocab id 0 (next_logits[:, 0]), with BF16 numerics and left padding so the final position is aligned across a batch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/sigridjineth/ctxl-rerank-v2-1b-seq-cls"&gt;https://huggingface.co/sigridjineth/ctxl-rerank-v2-1b-seq-cls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That design is great for clarity, but the causal-LM interface still exposes a full vocab projection, which isn’t ideal for CrossEncoder pipelines or classification-style serving.A small conversion fixes that. The Qwen3 discussion by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomaarsen/"&gt;Tom Aarsen&lt;/a&gt; on “Converting a reranker model to a single label classification model” showed how to collapse a generative head into a classifier by mapping label-word logits; for reranker v2 it’s even simpler, the score lives in a single channel.I copy lm_head.weight[0] into a 1-logit SequenceClassification head (bias zero or the matching LM bias), propagate pad/eos/bos ids to config, enforce left padding, and verify strict parity by comparing the classifier logit to next_logits[:, 0] under the same prompt, with a BF16→FP32 readout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sigridjineth_sigridjinethctxl-rerank-v2-1b-seq-cls-activity-7366726911789629440-a0HT?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;amp;rcm=ACoAABRjkPcB873c2QQdGuFf5vmfAJXAqmBQOOQ"&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sigridjineth_sigridjinethctxl-rerank-v2-1b-seq-cls-activity-7366726911789629440-a0HT?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;amp;rcm=ACoAABRjkPcB873c2QQdGuFf5vmfAJXAqmBQOOQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The result is numerically identical scores, lower overhead (1×H instead of V×H), and drop-in compatibility with CrossEncoder and standard classification tooling.If that’s useful, try the converted model. It ships with the conversion and parity scripts; stars, issues, and PRs (including 2B/6B variants) are welcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Ok_Rub1689"&gt; /u/Ok_Rub1689 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n25ygg/contextual_ai_reranker_v2_1b/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n25ygg/contextual_ai_reranker_v2_1b/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research team just released the best performing and most efficient reranker out there, and it's available now as an open weight model on HuggingFace. Rerankers are critical in context engineering: they improve retrieval accuracy, and help you make the best use of limited context, whether for RAG or another use case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reranker v2 was designed specifically for agentic RAG, supports instruction following, and is multilingual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Along with this, we're also open source our eval set, which allows you to reproduce our benchmark results. Back in March, when we introduced the world's first instruction-following reranker, it was SOTA on BEIR. After observing reranker use in production, we created an evaluation dataset that better matches real world use - focusing on QA-focused tests from several benchmarks. By releasing these datasets, we are also advancing instruction-following reranking evaluation, where high-quality benchmarks are currently limited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now all the weights for reranker V2 are live on HuggingFace: 1B, 2B, and 6B parameter models. I've been having fun building demos with earlier versions, like a reranker-based MCP server selector. Excited to try this out with the latest version!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please give it a try and let us know what you think.

Smarts or privacy, which side do you want to sacrifice? My answer is to use a small, fast local model as an intelligent privacy filter for the big cloud models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the obvious regex redaction doesn't work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most redaction tools, like &lt;a href="https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/features/masking"&gt;https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/features/masking&lt;/a&gt;, rely on regex. It's fast but brittle. A regex for a US SSN is useless for its UK/Canada counterparts, and there are hundreds of countries with their own ID formats. And how do you write a regex for arbitrary passwords or weirdly formatted API keys? You can't.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; perfectly redact everything, you run into a bigger problem. Most tools just swap your data with [REDACTED].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let's say someone asks AI assistant about a legal document:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Summarize the dispute between &lt;em&gt;John Doe&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jane Smith&lt;/em&gt; regarding the property at &lt;em&gt;123 Main St&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;John&lt;/em&gt;'s wife, &lt;em&gt;Mary Doe&lt;/em&gt;, is also a witness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Redaction creates this mess:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Summarize the dispute between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] regarding the property at [REDACTED]. [REDACTED]'s wife, [REDACTED], is also a witness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The context is destroyed, and the LLM is confused, and you get a garbage response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix: Local LLM as a Semantic Gatekeeper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of regex, we can use a local model to do this intelligently. Here's the workflow I came up with:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Your message sending to cloud LLM is first intercepted locally, like &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;My patient, Jensen Huang (ID: P12345), needs help...&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If sensitive data is found, local LLM will create a JSON map, like &lt;code&gt;{&amp;quot;Jensen Huang&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;${PATIENT_NAME}&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;P12345&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;${PATIENT_ID}&amp;quot;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The actual message sent to cloud would be &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;My patient, ${PATIENT_NAME} (ID: ${PATIENT_ID}), needs help...&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cloud AI assistant respond &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Here is what we need to do for ${PATIENT_NAME} ...&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The response is intercepted locally, to restore back sensitive data placeholders &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Here is what we need to do for Jensen Huang ...&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;So you get the final response as &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Here is what we need to do for Jensen Huang ...&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/0hdeej8j7olf1.png?width=3685&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3d154c9bc8e83ba1a67915e12f71dbcd759558b3"&gt;diagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this way, secrets never leave your machine. The cloud AI gets the semantic context it needs to be useful, but never sees the actual data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My implementation: PromptMask, a local LLM-based privacy filter for LLMs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can be installed as a python package &lt;code&gt;pip install promptmask&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aiming at seamless integration and user experience, I managed to implement two easy ways for use:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For python developer, it provides a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI SDK &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;from promptmask import OpenAIMasked as OpenAI &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;For everyone else, if you use apps that connect to an OpenAI-compatible API, you can run a local API gateway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install &amp;quot;promptmask[web]&amp;quot; promptmask-web &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;This spins up a server on localhost:8000. Point your app's API endpoint to &lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/gateway/v1/chat/completions"&gt;http://localhost:8000/gateway/v1/chat/completions&lt;/a&gt;, and in the promptmask config file, add your cloud AI provider URL as upstream, it will automatically handle the masking/unmasking for any tool you use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PromptMask itself does not include any LLM server, you will need to run a local model with Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GitHub Repo (MIT Licensed): &lt;a href="https://github.com/cxumol/promptmask"&gt;https://github.com/cxumol/promptmask&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;don't need a 70B model&lt;/strong&gt; to spot passwords and passport numbers. Together with PromptMask, I built an eval framework and benchmarked a bunch of models. The results show that even ~1B models can do the job with good few-shot prompting. See &lt;a href="https://github.com/cxumol/promptmask/blob/master/eval/benchmark.md"&gt;https://github.com/cxumol/promptmask/blob/master/eval/benchmark.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;---------&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a much deeper dive into the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;how,&amp;quot; including the prompt engineering for small models and the benchmark setup, I wrote a full blog post about it here: &lt;a href="https://xirtam.cxumol.com/promptmask-how-not-give-ai-secrets/"&gt;https://xirtam.cxumol.com/promptmask-how-not-give-ai-secrets/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'd love to get your feedback on this approach and the tool itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: add diagram, formatting, fix typos&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/cxu25"&gt; /u/cxu25 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n1y04u/using_a_local_llm_as_a_privacy_filter_for_gpt45/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n1y04u/using_a_local_llm_as_a_privacy_filter_for_gpt45/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

This allows you to generate speech for the equivalent of dozens of minutes. The longer the text, the longer the generation time (obviously).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I tested cloning my real voice. I only provided a 56-second sample, and the results were very positive. You can see them in the video.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;From my tests (not to be considered conclusive): when providing voice samples in a language other than English or Chinese (e.g. Italian), the model can generate speech in that same language (Italian) with a decent success rate. On the other hand, when providing English samples, I couldn’t get valid results when trying to generate speech in another language (e.g. Italian).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Speakers&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Node&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows up to 4 speakers (limit set by the Microsoft model). Results are decent only with the 7B model. The valid success rate is still much lower compared to single speaker generation. In short: the model looks very promising but still premature. The wrapper will still be adaptable to future updates of the model. Keep in mind the 7B model is still officially in &lt;em&gt;Preview&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much VRAM is needed?&lt;/strong&gt; Right now I’m only using the official models (so, maximum quality). The 1.5B model requires about &lt;strong&gt;5GB VRAM&lt;/strong&gt;, while the 7B model requires about &lt;strong&gt;17GB VRAM&lt;/strong&gt;. I haven’t tested on low-resource machines yet. To reduce resource usage, we’ll have to wait for quantized models or, if I find the time, I’ll try quantizing them myself (no promises).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts on this model:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A big step forward for the Open Weights ecosystem, and I’m really glad Microsoft released it. At its current stage, I see single-speaker generation as very solid, while multi-speaker is still too immature. But take this with a grain of salt. I may not have fully figured out how to get the best out of it yet. The real difference is the success rate between single-speaker and multi-speaker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This model is &lt;em&gt;heavily&lt;/em&gt; influenced by the seed. Some seeds produce fantastic results, while others are really bad. With images, such wide variation can be useful. For voice cloning, though, it would be better to have a more deterministic model where the seed matters less.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In practice, this means you have to experiment with several seeds before finding the perfect voice. That can work for some workflows but not for others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With multi-speaker, the problem gets worse because a single seed drives the entire conversation. You might get one speaker sounding great and another sounding off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personally, I think I’ll stick to using single-speaker generation even for multi-speaker conversations unless a future version of the model becomes more deterministic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That being said, it’s still a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; step forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL to ComfyUI Wrapper:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/Enemyx-net/VibeVoice-ComfyUI"&gt;https://github.com/Enemyx-net/VibeVoice-ComfyUI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Fabix84"&gt; /u/Fabix84 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://v.redd.it/yy7k60z8eplf1"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n24utb/released_comfyui_wrapper_for_microsofts_new/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>
