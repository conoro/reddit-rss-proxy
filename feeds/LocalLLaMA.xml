    <title>"Vibe Testing" — using LLMs to pressure-test spec docs before writing code, and it actually works</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;has anyone tried feeding a bunch of design/spec documents into context and asking it to trace through a realistic scenario step by step? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;we test code obsessively — unit tests, integration tests, e2e, the whole thing. but the specs that *define* what the code should do? we just review those in a meeting. maybe two people read them carefully. i started wondering if you could use LLMs to basically &amp;quot;unit test&amp;quot; your specs the same way you test code. been calling it &amp;quot;vibe testing&amp;quot; — like vibe coding but for the planning phase, you write a scenario and let the model vibe its way through your docs and tell you where things break down. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;the idea is simple: write a concrete scenario with a real persona and specific failure modes, dump all your spec docs into context, and ask the model to trace through it step by step. for each step it tells you which spec covers the behavior, and flags anything that's a gap (spec is silent), a conflict (two specs disagree), or an ambiguity (spec is unclear). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;so we had about 15 spec docs for a system — auth, payments, inventory, orders, notifications etc. reviewed them multiple times across the team. felt ready to build. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;i wrote up a short scenario — customer on mobile, payment gets declined, enters a different card, expects confirmation email — and dumped everything into context. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;it caught a bunch of stuff nobody noticed in review: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- payment spec says &amp;quot;retry 3 times with exponential backoff&amp;quot; but the user is entering a *new* card, not retrying the same one. is that a retry? new attempt? idempotency key reset? spec doesn't say. we all assumed &amp;quot;obviously new attempt&amp;quot; but it's literally not written down &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- inventory holds stock for 5 min. payment retry can take 6+. someone else can buy your items while you're still entering your card number. two specs with contradictory timing, neither references the other &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- auth tokens expire in 15 min, checkout on a bad connection can take longer, no refresh flow defined &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- payment succeeds but if the order service hiccups you've charged someone with no order record and there's no rollback defined &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;every one of these would have been a painful rewrite-level discovery weeks into building. the model found them in minutes because it's doing something we're bad at — holding all 15 docs in working memory and cross-referencing them without filling in gaps from experience. when a human reads &amp;quot;retry 3 times&amp;quot; your brain goes &amp;quot;yeah obviously we handle the new card case&amp;quot; and moves on. the model just says &amp;quot;this isn't defined&amp;quot; which is exactly what you want for this kind of testing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;some notes after trying this on a few projects: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- you need the context window for this. all the docs + scenario need to fit. this is one of the few cases where 100k+ context actually matters and isn't just a benchmark number&lt;br /&gt; - failure paths find way more gaps than happy paths. &amp;quot;what happens when X breaks&amp;quot; is where specs fall apart&lt;br /&gt; - pedantic models work better here. you want something that follows instructions literally and doesn't try to be helpful by filling in assumptions. more literal = better for this task&lt;br /&gt; - 4-5 scenarios varying user type, device, failure mode gives surprisingly good coverage. and specs that no scenario touches are themselves interesting — if no realistic user story hits a spec, why does it exist?&lt;br /&gt; - i've tried this with a few different models/sizes and it works as long as context is big enough and it can follow structured prompts &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;put the methodology + prompt template on github if anyone wants to mess with it: &lt;a href="http://github.com/knot0-com/vibe-testing"&gt;github.com/knot0-com/vibe-testing&lt;/a&gt; — nothing fancy, just a structured prompt you can use with whatever you're running locally &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;anyone have recommendations for which models handle this kind of long-context cross-referencing well? feels like it could be a decent real-world benchmark — &amp;quot;here's 10 docs with a planted contradiction, find it&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Opposite-Pea-7615"&gt; /u/Opposite-Pea-7615 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qspi72/vibe_testing_using_llms_to_pressuretest_spec_docs/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qspi72/vibe_testing_using_llms_to_pressuretest_spec_docs/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>How much improvement has there been (or seems likely to happen in the future) for clustering mac computers than have Thunderbolt-4 ports (not Thunderbolt-5). I realize the big breakthrough with RDMA last month was for Thunderbolt-5, but I am curious about Thunderbolt-4 mac clusters.</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, back in December when there was all that buzz about RDMA, and Exo and the big RDMA improvement for clustering macs, but only macs that had Thunderbolt-5, I didn't look into it much at the time, but, from what I remembered, it seemed like in the past, if you clustered a bunch of mac minis (or similar macs with Thunderbolt 4 connections), you could pool their memory and run bigger models, but, not only would you not gain any speed from the clustering, but instead you would more like lose a bunch of speed, and it would run something like 10 times slower than what a single mac with that amount of memory would be able to do on its own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even that was still kind of interesting, actually, since sometimes I don't mind a 10x slowdown if it means I get to use a bigger, more powerful model, but, obviously hard to be nearly as excited about that as a Thunderbolt-5 RDMA cluster that not only doesn't slow down 10x, but instead more like speeds up 2x.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, I don't really know anything about clustering, or vLLM, or really, hardly anything about computers or running AI models, as I am fairly new to this, and don't have a background in computers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do have several mac computers though, (mostly cheap base model mac minis with thunderbolt 4 ports), and I am kind of curious about non-Thunderbolt-5 mac clustering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing that recently made me a bit more curious is, I heard that maybe it doesn't necessarily have to be some big 20x or 10x slowdown when you cluster them on Thunderbolt-4, that maybe that's only if you do it wrong, or that maybe some other sorts of advancements got made, even regarding Thunderbolt-4, not in as good or official of a way as what happened with Thunderbolt-5 and RDMA, but, better than nothing, and also that more improvements for clustering macs with Thunderbolt-4 might be coming in the near future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, since there are probably a lot of people on here who have two or more base mac minis or lower level macs, but don't have numerous mac studios, or people in mixed situations with it (1 mac studio, and 1 or more base mac minis), I figured maybe there are others who might be curious about this, or know something about it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, is it still like a 10x-20x slowdown to cluster the non-Thunderbolt-5 macs? Or is it not quite that bad? Does it seem like even-speed clustering (or even speed-gain clustering) could be on the horizon for Thunderbolt-4 (in a non-official way, rather than coming through Apple, I mean)? What is the best current setup to get the best speeds from a Thunderbolt-4 mac cluster? What seems the most promising thing, and thing I should be checking, if I want to see if any breakthroughs happen for Thunderbolt-4 mac clustering performance? And what should I read or where should I start if I want to learn more about clustering in general, for using LLMs?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/MistressMedium123lb"&gt; /u/MistressMedium123lb &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsw2wn/how_much_improvement_has_there_been_or_seems/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsw2wn/how_much_improvement_has_there_been_or_seems/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>Here is why you should/shouldn't purchase Strix Halo</title>
    <updated>2026-02-01T12:12:11+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all,this is NOT AI-generated, it's just concise and structured so I don't waste your time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What's strix halo? Strix halo is a compact Mini-PC that's optimized for AI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can I use strix halo for other things other than AI? Yes, it uses standard 64-bit architecture so most programs/Operating systems will run normally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First you need to ask some questions to know if strix halo is suitable for you:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is your use case AI inference? Suitable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you need high amount of ram over bandwidth? Suitable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are you planning to use it for fine-tuning?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It will work due to the amount of ram,but it won't be fast due to memory bandwidth limits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How optimized are it's drivers? Much better now,ROCm is well optimized but you may want to compile the programs you need for best performance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it reliable? Yes,most strix halo Mini-PCs are reliable under consistent load.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What's the best Linux distro for strix halo? Fedora 43.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How efficient is it? Very efficient compared to performance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is cooling reliable? Based on manufacturer,but generally yes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strix halo or DGX spark? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compatibility with general programs → strix halo (due to DGX Spark being ARM-based).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AI libraries compatibility → DGX Spark (due to CUDA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clustering → DGX Spark (strix halo is very bottlenecked in memory bandwidth if you connect two units because it doesn't contain dedicated hardware for multi-unit clustering that DGX Spark contains).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Price → strix halo (DGX Spark is nearly double the price).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Performance → almost identical (Both have similar memory bandwidth,Spark is generally faster in prefill,but token generation speed is nearly-identical).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Best performance for lowest price → Bosgame M5.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let's discover other possibilities you may think of:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why not used 3090 with 128GB of used DDR5?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Electricity → strix halo is more efficient,so lower bill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Performance → the 3090 is so fast, but you probably need to offload so lower speeds, unless it's acceptable and you rarely run models larger than 30B so it's faster because u be on GPU more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Safety → used parts are high-risk,you may receive genuine 3090, a modified one or a brick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ok,why not a refurbished/used Mac M1 Ultra instead?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mac M1 ultra has the some of the same problems that the DGX Spark contains because it's an ARM CPU,So it's still less compatible as a daily driver,unless your main use case is professional and don't mind never running an OS other than MacOS,it has 800 GB of bandwidth so nearly 3x of the strix and the spark.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Best models for strix halo are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GPT-OSS-120B → generalist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GLM-4.6V → vision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GLM-4.7-Flash → coding and Agentic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MiniMax 2.2 → again,coding and agentic,you need a quantized REAP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B → good for multilingual tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's it,wish I could help good enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsww1g/here_is_why_you_shouldshouldnt_purchase_strix_halo/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsww1g/here_is_why_you_shouldshouldnt_purchase_strix_halo/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>Ultra-Sparse MoEs are the future</title>

Like we can create a 120B that uses fine-grained expert system → distill it into a 30B A3B → again into 7B A1B all trained in MXFP4?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That would be perfect because it solves the issue of direct distillation (model can't approximate the much larger teacher internal representations due to high complexity) while allowing to run models on actual consumer hardware from 96-128GB of ram → 24GB GPUs → 8GB GPUs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A more efficient reasoning would be also a great idea! I noticed that specifically in GPT-OSS-120B (low) where it thinks in 1 or 2 words and follows a specific structure we had a great advancement for spec decoding for that model because it's predictable so it's faster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsx9r0/ultrasparse_moes_are_the_future/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsx9r0/ultrasparse_moes_are_the_future/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

After some environment tuning, the setup is rock solid—memory management is no longer an issue, and the Oryon cores are absolutely ripping through tokens. However, running purely on CPU feels like owning a Ferrari and never leaving second gear. I want to tap into the Adreno 830 GPU or the Hexagon NPU to see what this silicon can really do. The Challenge: Standard Ollama/llama.cpp builds in Termux default to CPU. I’m looking for anyone who has successfully bridged the gap to the hardware accelerators on this specific chip. Current leads I'm investigating: OpenCL/Vulkan Backends: Qualcomm recently introduced a new OpenCL GPU backend for llama.cpp specifically for Adreno. Has anyone successfully compiled this in Termux with the correct libOpenCL.so links from /system/vendor/lib64?.&lt;br /&gt; QNN (Qualcomm AI Engine Direct): There are experimental GGML_HTP (Hexagon Tensor Processor) backends appearing in some research forks. Has anyone managed to get the QNN SDK libraries working natively in Termux to offload the KV cache?. Vulkan via Turnip: With the Adreno 8-series being so new, are the current Turnip drivers stable enough for llama-cpp-backend-vulkan?. If you’ve moved past CPU-only inference on the 8 Elite, how did you handle the library dependencies? Let’s figure out how to make neobild the fastest mobile LLM implementation out there. 🛠️&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/NeoLogic_Dev"&gt; /u/NeoLogic_Dev &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.redd.it/8hdxiuxhevgg1.jpeg"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qswba2/llama_32_3b_on_snapdragon_8_elite_cpu_is_fast_but/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

The use case I care about is games: I’d love to run an LLM locally inside a game to handle logic, dialogue, and structured outputs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right now my game depends on an API model (Gemini 3 Flash). It works great, but obviously that’s not viable for selling a game long-term if it requires an external API.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So my question is:&lt;br /&gt; Do you think we’ll see, in the not-too-distant future, a &lt;strong&gt;small local model&lt;/strong&gt; that can reliably:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Generate strict JSON&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reason at roughly Gemini 3 Flash levels (or close)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Handle large contexts (ideally 50k–100k tokens)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or are we fundamentally constrained by model size here, with improvements mostly coming from scale rather than efficiency?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curious to hear thoughts from people following quantization, distillation, MoE, and architectural advances closely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/estebansaa"&gt; /u/estebansaa &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsjqdl/are_small_models_actually_getting_more_efficient/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsjqdl/are_small_models_actually_getting_more_efficient/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kinda regret buying b60. I thought that 24gb for 700 eur is a great deal, but the reality is completely different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For starters, I live with a custom compiled kernel with the patch from an Intel dev to solve ffmpeg crashes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then I had to install the card into a windows machine in order to get GPU firmware updated (under Linux one need v2.0.19 of fwupd which is not available in Ubuntu yet) to solve the crazy fan speed on the b60 even when the temp of the gpu is 30 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But even after solving all of this, the actual experience doing local LLM on b60 is meh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On llama.cpp the card goes crazy every time it does inference: fans go super high then low, the high again. The speed is about 10-15tks at best in models like mistral 14b. The noise level is just unbearable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the only reliable way is intel’s llm-scaler, but as of now it’s based on vllm 0.11.1 whereas latest version of vllm is 0.15. So Intel is like 6 months behind which is an eternity in this AI bubble times. For example any of new mistral models are not supported and one cannot run them on vanilla vllm too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With llm-scaler the behavior of the card is ok: when it’s doing inference the fan goes louder and stays louder as long is it’s needed. The speed is like 20-25 tks on qwen3 VL 8b. However there are only some models that work with llm-scaler and most of them only with fp8, so for example qwen3 VL 8b after some requests processed with 16k length takes 20gb. That kinda bad: you have 24gb of vram but you cannot run normally 30b model with q4 quant and has to stick with 8b model with fp8.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall I think XFX 7900XTX would have been much better deal: same 24gb, 2x faster, in Dec the price was only 50 eur more than b60, it can run newest models with newest llama.cpp versions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/damirca"&gt; /u/damirca &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsenpy/dont_buy_b60_for_llms/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsenpy/dont_buy_b60_for_llms/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Yes they may not perform the best compared to other openweight models, but OLMO models are fully open sourced, from their datasets to training recipes. So it's nice to see them experiment with more niche techniques.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems like for 3.5, they'll be using some of the techniques that Qwen3-Next introduced, so long context tasks should take less memory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though this series seems to be a set of Dense models, with the smallest being a 1B model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;OLMo 3.5 Hybrid is a hybrid architecture model from Ai2 that combines standard transformer attention layers with linear attention layers using the Gated Deltanet.

This is usually the other way around. You take a smart base, tune a model on it, and accept the sacrifice of some intelligence to give it flavor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first I thought &amp;quot;OK nice, a coincidence, who cares?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then I looked more closely at the scores:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1) The abliterated base &lt;strong&gt;scored higher&lt;/strong&gt; than the base.&lt;br /&gt; 2) The finetune scored even &lt;strong&gt;higher than both&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; 3) The finetune was literally on an extremely noise 4chan dataset, it should have eaten glue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then I remembered something: the original, gpt4chan (by Yannic Kilcher) scored especially high in truthfulness (that was b4 benchmaxxing).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I took a closer look on recent models I released; the abliterated Impish_LLAMA_4B not only outperformed the base tune (the unabliterated one), it also changed its political alignment (you can check for yourself the UGI stats, I feel like I spammed enough images). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People were initially joking about the &amp;quot;alignment tax&amp;quot;, I think there's a none trivial substance in all of this. It seems to me just above a marginal error or statistical noise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh, and the KL divergence for Impish_LLAMA_4B was :&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Sicarius_The_First"&gt; /u/Sicarius_The_First &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsrscu/can_4chan_data_really_improve_a_model_turns_out/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsrscu/can_4chan_data_really_improve_a_model_turns_out/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <title>Falcon-H1-Tiny (90M) is out - specialized micro-models that actually work</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TII just dropped Falcon-H1-Tiny - a series of sub-100M models that quietly challenge the scaling dogma. We've all suspected that narrow, specialized smal models tend to hallucinate less than giant generalists. After all, a 90M parameter model has far less internal &amp;quot;room&amp;quot; to drift off-topic or invent facts outside its training scope. But this release &lt;em&gt;proves&lt;/em&gt; it with numbers - and flips the script on how we think about capability at tiny scales.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's actually new&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-curriculum training&lt;/strong&gt;: Instead of pretraining on web junk then fine-tuning, they inject target-domain data (SFT, reasoning traces, tool calls) from token #1. For 90M models with ~5 GT memorization windows, this works - no overfitting even after 100+ epochs on high-quality data.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid Mamba+Attention blocks&lt;/strong&gt; inherited from Falcon-H1, plus Learnable Multipliers + Muon optimizer (up to 20% relative gain over AdamW).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialized variants that punch above weight&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;90M tool-caller hits 94.44% relevance detection (knows &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; to call a function) matches 270M Function Gemma globally despite weaker AST accuracy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;600M reasoning model (R-0.6B) post-GRPO solves 75% of AIME24 problems pass@1 - competitive with 7B-class models when scaled at inference&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;90M coder with native FIM support runs autocomplete inside VS Code via Continue plugin&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this matters for local deployment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Models this size (~90 MB quantized Q8_0) run on any modern phone or Raspberry Pi without breaking a sweat. They're not trying to replace your 7B daily driver they're purpose-built for constrained environments where footprint and latency dominate. And if you scaled these designs to ~1B parameters (11×), the'd likely cover 90% of everyday local use cases: chat, tool calling, light coding, reasoning traces - all while staying under 500 MB even quantized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Base 90M instruct model: &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/Falcon-H1-Tiny-R-90M"&gt;https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/Falcon-H1-Tiny-R-90M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Full model collection: &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/models"&gt;https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Technical blogpost with experiments: &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/tiiuae/tiny-h1-blogpost"&gt;https://huggingface.co/spaces/tiiuae/tiny-h1-blogpost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/United-Manner-7"&gt; /u/United-Manner-7 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsx51z/falconh1tiny_90m_is_out_specialized_micromodels/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qsx51z/falconh1tiny_90m_is_out_specialized_micromodels/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

The subreddit has grown to 500k users - inevitably, some users like a niche community with more technical discussion and fewer memes (even if relevant).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have a discord bot to test out open source models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better contest and events organization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Best for quick questions or showcasing your rig!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/HOLUPREDICTIONS"&gt; /u/HOLUPREDICTIONS &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mpk2va"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mpk2va/announcing_localllama_discord_server_bot/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>
