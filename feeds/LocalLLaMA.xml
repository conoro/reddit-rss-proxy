Rather than merely producing &amp;quot;plausible-sounding answers&amp;quot; or high-frequency vague recommendations like &amp;quot;you should see a doctor soon,&amp;quot; the model is trained to &lt;strong&gt;proactively acquire critical clinical information&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;construct coherent medical reasoning pathways&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;systematically constrain hallucination-prone behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/baichuan-inc/Baichuan-M3-235B#core-highlights"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Core Highlights&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Surpasses GPT-5.2&lt;/strong&gt;: Outperforms OpenAI's latest model across HealthBench, HealthBench-Hard, hallucination evaluation, and BCOSCE, establishing a new SOTA in medical AI&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;🩺 &lt;strong&gt;High-Fidelity Clinical Inquiry&lt;/strong&gt;: The only model to rank first across all three BCOSCE dimensions—Clinical Inquiry, Laboratory Testing, and Diagnosis&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;🧠 &lt;strong&gt;Low Hallucination, High Reliability&lt;/strong&gt;: Achieves substantially lower hallucination rates than GPT-5.2 through Fact-Aware RL, even without external tools&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;⚡ &lt;strong&gt;Efficient Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;: W4 quantization reduces memory to 26% of original; Gated Eagle3 speculative decoding achieves 96% speedup&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/jacek2023"&gt; /u/jacek2023 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/baichuan-inc/Baichuan-M3-235B"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qbjbrf/baichuanincbaichuanm3235b_hugging_face/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <title>Using local VLMs for OCR to feed into an NLP categorization pipeline - looking for beta testers (Loggr)</title>

The core is a custom NLP pipeline that extracts structured health data from free-form text - food, exercise, supplements, sleep, etc. No LLM in the loop for extraction, sub-100ms latency, works on an air-gapped device.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently adding a feature to scan handwritten journals. Testing with Qwen2.5-VL-3B quantized via MLX for the OCR step, then feeding that text into the same pipeline. The 3B fits comfortably in 8GB unified memory, 7B needs 12GB+ but handles messier handwriting better. Running it as a batch process overnight since you're potentially processing years of journals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Considered Apple's Vision framework but the handwriting recognition is hit or miss compared to the VLMs. Might end up doing a hybrid approach - Vision for quick preview, VLM for the actual extraction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking for beta testers with old paper journals to throw at it. Especially interested in edge cases - bad handwriting, mixed languages, weird layouts. Sign up at &lt;a href="http://loggr.info"&gt;loggr.info&lt;/a&gt; if you want to help stress test. I'll send you a beta build and you run your entries through it, then tell me how it went/ send me some human-readable diagnostics data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What VLMs are people using for OCR these days? Qwen2.5-VL seems to be the go-to but curious if there's anything better for handwriting specifically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Mescallan"&gt; /u/Mescallan &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qcd8sw/using_local_vlms_for_ocr_to_feed_into_an_nlp/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qcd8sw/using_local_vlms_for_ocr_to_feed_into_an_nlp/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To really make sure there is no misunderstanding here it is played out:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like eating hotdogs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Model 1: I, eat, hot&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Model2: like,ing, dogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a simulation to demonstrate the idea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So why? And is it worth it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first thought that came my mind was clearly it will be slower… but I wondered if a few adjustments to the software could ensure the context isn’t fully reprocessed for each model each time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My next thought was how would two different model families handle this? For example GPT-OSS 120b and GLM-4.6V? What happens when the east meets west? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happens if you always did inference on a smaller model, but only used it when it predicted the next word with high confidence and/or it was a common word (the, a, an, has, etc.) from the top 200 English words? Would this be faster than a draft model with a larger model and how much less accurate would it be? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One idea that came to mind is the fingerprint of the models would get muddied. How muddied? Only one way to find out. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And here you might get a little grumpy. I’m still at work and my knowledge to accomplish this is pretty narrow so I can’t give you this answer… yet. But a helpful upvote and a comment from you should get this some visibility so that those that have done this or have the knowledge to do so can beat me to providing you and I with an answer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you done something wacky like this?

Recently, I replaced my 13600K in my desktop with a 14700K, and sent the 13600K back to Intel for warranty replacement due to the Vmin shift issue. Everyone knows what happens when you have spare parts, it turns into a whole new build...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wanted to document this whole experience because there are very few reports out there about Blackwell setups and problems, and the ones that exist are mostly unresolved threads (see &lt;a href="https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?threads/msi-pro-z790-p-wifi-ddr4-no-boot-with-rtx-pro-blackwell.412240/"&gt;https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?threads/msi-pro-z790-p-wifi-ddr4-no-boot-with-rtx-pro-blackwell.412240/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1kt3uoi/finally_got_the_rtx_6000_blackwell_workstation/"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1kt3uoi/finally_got_the_rtx_6000_blackwell_workstation/&lt;/a&gt; ). Also because it was something like 12 hours of torture getting it all figured out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;NVIDIA RTX 6000 Pro (Blackwell)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;MSI Pro Z790‑P&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Meshroom S v2 15L case&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;128GB DDR5‑6400, Samsung 990 Pro 4TB&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;After getting the whole system built and put together the RTX 6000 installed, the system wouldn’t POST at all. EZ Debug LEDs would light up red -&amp;gt; yellow -&amp;gt; red -&amp;gt; yellow and then die, never reaching white or green. Just everything black.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I pulled the RTX 6000 and booted on the iGPU, that posted and dropped me into the UEFI. That also helped me understand how the EZ Debug LEDs should behave:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Red -&amp;gt; Yellow -&amp;gt; White -&amp;gt; Green -&amp;gt; UEFI. With the iGPU, the sequence was perfect. With the RTX 6000, it died, just black after yellow.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once I got into BIOS on the iGPU, I tried the settings that people mentioned in other threads:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Disable CSM for pure UEFI&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Enable Above 4GB decoding for crypto mining support (some funky msi option, I don't think I've ever heard of this before)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Disable ReBAR&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The blackwell board doesn't seem to be able to negotiate rebar with the mobo, whatever, all disabled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So... I reinstalled the RTX6000 and it POSTs, wow... then... I updated the BIOS... shit. The card wouldn't POST anymore... then I tried the iGPU, that shit wouldn't work either, the graphics would constantly get busted in BIOS everytime the iGPU booted up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the RTX6000 and iGPU both wouldn't boot up into a working state, I pulled out my old old old Geforce 760 and plugged it in, and it POST fine and dropped into UEFI just fine. At this point, I tried downgrading BIOS just to see if iGPU would work, it didn't, same corrupt graphics in BIOS issue, and the blackwell wouldn't POST at all either. I took a look at the settings again and saw that CSM was still disabled, but the other settings for &amp;gt;4GB decoding and disabling rebar were reset. I put them back into place, reinstalled the RTX6000, and that shit POSTs again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Key takeaways from this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stay away from MSI, they have broken GPU support in this situation. And they refuse to acknowledge it, other than saying that they will not support the RTX6000 on a consumer board, despite it being a standard PCIE5 card.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;iGPU is also broken under MSI when CSM is disabled for pure UEFI&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;BIOS updates wipes settings that leaves the blackwell card unusable and the system in a broken state unless the card is pulled and another discrete gpu is put in, maybe other Z790 boards would work with just iGPU, I haven't tried.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;What's next:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I spent like 12 hours figuring this all out, so I'm going to use the mobo as is for a few more days while I get the sytem fully built, then I'll replace it with another Z790 from someone else, hopefully I don't have as much of a pain with it. But upon further shopping, sadly, it looks like the Z790-P is the only board available locally for me that supports 64gb ram sticks. All the other Z790 boards 128-192GB of ram max&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I've finished setting up Debian13 and Steam. Trying to get 4K120 working on my TV, but no luck with that yet, ugh.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Setting up vLLM, Docker, ComfyUI, etc. Already have llama.cpp running, but would prefer a more solid/production type of setup.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I started running some models, and qwen3-vl 235b in Q5/Q6 quants... I need more ram, these models put me at exactly my full system ram on both gpu and dram and barely enough for anything else. llama.cpp with &lt;code&gt;--fit on --fit-target 8192 --fit-ctx CTXSIZE --mlock&lt;/code&gt; are gamechangers, this lets the dense part of the LLM sit in gpu, some moe in gpu, and the rest offloaded to sysram. It's not great performance, but I can still get something like 5-8 tokens/second running on ~200GB model sizes. I want to get another 128gb of ram so that I can go up to about 250GB models and still leave some room for other tasks in sysram. or maybe adjust the gpu/cpu allocation more so that I can run other models in vram such as SD or LTX-2 concurrently&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/pfn0"&gt; /u/pfn0 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qc1isk"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qc1isk/rtx_6000_pro_blackwell_wouldnt_post_on_msi_z790p/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

I use Vulkan because ROCm seems intermittently unstable. I'm running one agent on each card, mostly Qwen3-vl-30b-a3b Q5 quants (decent performance:context window trade-off), Devstral2-24b, Qwen3-coder, and sometimes Nemotron for simple tasks, but Nemotron has been unimpressive and prone to error during heavy tool use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess my bifurcated motherboard lacks P2P, so loading a big 52GB Qwen-Next-32B model across both GPUs works and gets like ~28 tok/s from zero-shot, but there is still a bottleneck with it juggling read-write across the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The limitation forced me to run separate quantized agents, which has been better for productivity and I prefer HITL. (I launch 2x LM Studio instances as a fish function, w/separate APIs and shared qdrant+Neo4j+postgres+memory servers via MCP for long-memory coordination in projects. This allows me to have an orchestration model on GPU0 write and execute python scripts that are queued on GPU1's API. (This coordinated governance structure also aligns with the new &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tez4AyTm1Rs"&gt;Atlas method&lt;/a&gt; of Agent Orchestration.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just wanted to share my experience since I know these cards are new'ish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hope everyone had a great day!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; RocmBandwidthTest Version: 2.6.0 Launch Command is: rocm-bandwidth-test (rocm_bandwidth -a + rocm_bandwidth -A) Device: 0, Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 7 265KF Device: 1, AMD Radeon Graphics, GPU-[UUID1], 04:0.0 Device: 2, AMD Radeon Graphics, GPU-[UUID2], 08:0.0 Inter-Device Access D/D 0 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 2 1 0 1 Inter-Device Numa Distance D/D 0 1 2 0 0 20 20 1 20 0 N/A 2 20 N/A 0 Unidirectional copy peak bandwidth GB/s D/D 0 1 2 0 N/A 28.622 28.727 1 28.160 449.668 N/A 2 28.099 N/A 571.232 Bidirectional copy peak bandwidth GB/s D/D 0 1 2 0 N/A 33.557 34.633 1 33.557 N/A N/A 2 34.633 N/A N/A &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/-philosopath-"&gt; /u/-philosopath- &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.redd.it/j6k5y1je58dg1.png"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qcc3dg/two_asrock_radeon_ai_pro_r9700s_cooking_in_cachyos/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

The core mechanic isn't a dialogue tree. It’s a direct interface with local LLMs. My goal was to make a polished, atmospheric experience that runs entirely offline on mid-range consumer hardware.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The game runs a local &lt;strong&gt;Llama-3.1-8B (Q4_K_M)&lt;/strong&gt; instance. I am using tauri and llama-server with vulkan support. The UI is a custom WebGL-driven &amp;quot;OS&amp;quot; that simulates a retro-future terminal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Targeting &lt;strong&gt;6GB VRAM&lt;/strong&gt; was the biggest challenge. I had to keep low context window like 2048-4096 the LLM’s KV cache.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this clip, I’m testing a bribery scenario. NPC tries to bribe me with bribe action, basically function calling at the end of the prompt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have tested with RTX2060 and 4070Ti Super and it both works realtime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am planning to train a custom LoRA specifically for the game’s world and essentially eliminate any remaining hallucinations. It works surprisingly well right now, but a dedicated fine-tune will be the final step for total immersion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would like to hear your thoughts!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit :&lt;br /&gt; I managed to get the VRAM usage down to ~5.3 GB for Llama 3.1 8B by sticking to a 4096 context window and enabling Flash Attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To handle that tight context limit, I’m using a vector DB and a RAG pipeline. It basically &amp;quot;swaps in&amp;quot; relevant lore and action tags on the fly so the AI stays smart without the prompt bloating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Performance is surprisingly solid on mid-range gear:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTX 4070:&lt;/strong&gt; ~70 TPS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTX 2060 (6GB):&lt;/strong&gt; ~15-20 TPS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was actually skeptical about the 2060 since there’s only about 700MB of headroom left for the OS and other apps, but it hasn't been an issue at all. It runs super smooth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/bayhan2000"&gt; /u/bayhan2000 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://v.redd.it/rrveazsgq6dg1"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qc485u/building_a_game_where_you_talk_to_npcs_using/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/Echo9Zulu/Shadows-Gemma-3-1B"&gt;Shadows-Gemma-1B&lt;/a&gt; was trained for the google tunix hackathon and is my first finetuning project. Trained on 1569 samples in ~10 minutes on TPUv5-8e, and around 20min on A40, Shadows-Gemma is a general reasoning model trained without RL, code or math data distilled from non reasoning teacher gemma-3-4b-it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When looking at topk20 logprob data, I noticed that some tokens appear early in the low ranks, and sort of float around until eventually being selected much later. It turns out, when the average distance between first appearance and selection is greater, the features we know from reasoning traces- backtracking, solution exploration, drafting, rewriting, were more prominent in the training data when &amp;quot;persistence&amp;quot; was higher. I'm calling these shadow tokens, and they may indicate reasoning behavior in the output distribution and surface text. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shadows-Gemma-1B was trained using logprob distillation from teacher gemma-3-4b-it, which I rejection sampled to meet the following system prompt, which encourages interleaved reasoning;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; You are Gemma, a thinking model who reasons through problems step by step before providing an answer. Conduct your reasoning within a &amp;lt;reasoning&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/reasoning&amp;gt; block, with intermediate steps using &amp;lt;processing&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/processing&amp;gt; tags, with the intermediate step inside. Continue like this until closing the &amp;lt;/reasoning&amp;gt; block and providing your answer within &amp;lt;answer&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/answer&amp;gt;. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once I started modeling token trajectories forward towards the end of a completion, I kept seeing the pattern &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;, in other language models as well. Knowing more research, evaluation and compute would be required to study shadow tokens, I set myself on empirically demonstrating that shadow tokens are a trainable signal, which is about all I can say for sure at this time. Regardless, Shadow-Gemma-1B gives better answers on most questions I have tried and has become a generally capable reasoning model, thinking more on harder questions. To be clear, I'm not saying Shadows-Gemma beats any other model, even the base model, at a given task.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am working on a post mortem with more details about the adventure, loss functions, code optimizations, interpretability data analysis tools, war stories from a one week port of pytorch --&amp;gt; JAX framework, discuss how SOTA LLMs were not always useful etc. Other datasets I made for this project will also be published soon:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;~4800 Reasoning traces from DeepCogito-v2.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full solutions for GSM8K by DeepSeekProverv2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/Echo9Zulu/Shadows-Gemma-3-4B"&gt;Shadows-Gemma-3-4B&lt;/a&gt; was a last minute full send using some runpod credits I had leftover just to see if it would work.

    <title>Built an 8× RTX 3090 monster… considering nuking it for 2× Pro 6000 Max-Q</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been running an 8× RTX 3090 box on an EPYC 7003 with an ASUS ROMED8-2T and 512 GB DDR4-3200.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The setup is not pretty. Lots of PCIe risers, I didn’t know about MCIO 8 months ago. The board has 7× x16 Gen4 slots, so for the 8th GPU I’m using an x8/x8 bifurcator plus a daisy-chained riser: motherboard to riser to bifurcator to GPU 1 on the bifurcator and GPU 2 on another riser. This is purely because of physical space and riser length limits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As expected, things are weird. One GPU runs at x8, the other at x4, likely the daisy-chained riser but I haven’t had time to deep-debug. Another GPU shows up as x8 even when it shouldn’t, either a jumper I’m missing or a 3090 with a mining or modded vBIOS. Stability only became acceptable after forcing all PCIe slots to Gen3 Although I still see one of the x8 GPUs &amp;quot;faiiling off the PCI bus&amp;quot; (shows up as NA on nvtop) and leads me to reboot the server(10minutes to vllm readiness).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of this Frankenstein setup, I’m considering replacing the whole thing with 2× RTX Pro 6000 Max-Q, basically trading 8 riser-mounted 3090s for a clean dual-GPU build. This would triple the cost of the system. My 3090s were about $600 each, while the Max-Qs are quoted at about $8,300 each.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Putting elegance and some hit-or-miss stability gains aside, is there any real performance upside here?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quick power-efficiency napkin math says it would take about 7.1 years of nonstop usage to break even compared to the 8×3090 setup. I could switch from AWQ to NVFP4 quantization. How much performance should I realistically expect for AI coding agents like Claude Code and OpenCode?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would prefill latency improve in a meaningful way?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;VRAM would be roughly the same today, with room to add 2 more GPUs later without risers and potentially double max VRAM. But is this even a good platform for FP8 coding models like MiniMax 2.1 or GLM 4.7?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Am I missing any real advantages here, or is this mostly an expensive way to clean up a messy but functional setup?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/BeeNo7094"&gt; /u/BeeNo7094 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qc81si/built_an_8_rtx_3090_monster_considering_nuking_it/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qc81si/built_an_8_rtx_3090_monster_considering_nuking_it/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I released NovaSR which is a very tiny 52kb audio upsampler that enhances muffled 16khz audio to produce clearer 48khz audio. It's incredibly small and really fast(can process 100 to 3600 seconds of audio in just 1 second on a single gpu).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why is it useful?&lt;br /&gt; 1. It can enhance any TTS models quality. Most generate at 16khz or 24khz and NovaSR can enhance them with nearly 0 computation cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can restore low quality audio datasets really quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can fit basically on any device. It's just 52kb which basically means its smaller then a 3 second audio file itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right now, it was only trained on just 100 hours of data so it has room for improvement, but it still produces good quality audio at such a tiny size.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Github repo: &lt;a href="https://github.com/ysharma3501/NovaSR"&gt;https://github.com/ysharma3501/NovaSR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Model with some examples: &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/YatharthS/NovaSR"&gt;https://huggingface.co/YatharthS/NovaSR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Space to try it(It's running on a weak 2 core cpu machine so won't be 3600x realtime but still around 10x realtime): &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/YatharthS/NovaSR"&gt;https://huggingface.co/spaces/YatharthS/NovaSR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stars or Likes would be appreciated if found helpful.

It can run up to &lt;strong&gt;20x realtime&lt;/strong&gt; on CPU, and up to &lt;strong&gt;2000x&lt;/strong&gt; on GPU. It also supports lossless streaming with &lt;strong&gt;15 ms latency&lt;/strong&gt;, an order of magnitude lower than any other TTS model. You can check out Soprano here:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Github:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/ekwek1/soprano"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://github.com/ekwek1/soprano&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demo:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/ekwek/Soprano-TTS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://huggingface.co/spaces/ekwek/Soprano-TTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/ekwek/Soprano-80M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://huggingface.co/ekwek/Soprano-80M&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, I am releasing training code for you guys! This was by far the most requested feature to be added, and I am happy to announce that you can now train your own ultra-lightweight, ultra-realistic TTS models like the one in the video with your &lt;strong&gt;own data&lt;/strong&gt; on your &lt;strong&gt;own hardware&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Soprano-Factory&lt;/strong&gt;! Using Soprano-Factory, you can add new &lt;strong&gt;voices&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;styles&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;languages&lt;/strong&gt; to Soprano. The entire repository is just 600 lines of code, making it easily customizable to suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to the training code, I am also releasing &lt;strong&gt;Soprano-Encoder&lt;/strong&gt;, which converts raw audio into audio tokens for training. You can find both here:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soprano-Factory:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/ekwek1/soprano-factory"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://github.com/ekwek1/soprano-factory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soprano-Encoder:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/ekwek/Soprano-Encoder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://huggingface.co/ekwek/Soprano-Encoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy it! See you tomorrow,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- Eugene&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I did not originally design Soprano with finetuning in mind. As a result, I cannot guarantee that you will see good results after training. Personally, I have my doubts that an 80M-parameter model trained on just 1000 hours of data can generalize to OOD datasets, but I have seen bigger miracles on this sub happen, so knock yourself out :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/eugenekwek"&gt; /u/eugenekwek &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://v.redd.it/wnuwfpdqz6dg1"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qc5nml/soprano_tts_training_code_released_create_your/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

In general image generation quality, GLM‑Image aligns with mainstream latent diffusion approaches, but it shows significant advantages in text-rendering and knowledge‑intensive generation scenarios. It performs especially well in tasks requiring precise semantic understanding and complex information expression, while maintaining strong capabilities in high‑fidelity and fine‑grained detail generation. In addition to text‑to‑image generation, GLM‑Image also supports a rich set of image‑to‑image tasks including image editing, style transfer, identity‑preserving generation, and multi‑subject consistency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Model architecture: a hybrid autoregressive + diffusion decoder design.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/foldl-li"&gt; /u/foldl-li &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-Image"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qc9m6x/glmimage_is_released/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>
