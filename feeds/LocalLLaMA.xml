I do want to learn how to set this up though&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Never done any of this before, I'm running true NAS community edition on my server. I think I need at least 16 gigs of video memory? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Want to generate stories for d&amp;amp;d, make artwork for my campaigns, do some finance work at work. Want all of this local. So I need to train a model with mine and my friend's photos along with all of our hand drawn artwork. I don't know what that process is or how much resources that takes? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;have a 2070 super laying around, I think that's too old though? It's only 8 gig &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found the k80 series cards for very cheap but again I think those are too old &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The p40 at 24 gigs is cheap. However from what I've seen it slow? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4070 TI is about double the cost of a p-40 but 16 gigs. I think it's a hell of a lot faster though. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have a 5600x computer 32 ram and my server is an i3 12th gen with 128 gigs of RAM. Idk which I would leverage first? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My main desktop is a 7950x with 3080 10gb 48 ram maybe I run a VM box with Linux to play around with this on the desktop? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think the 380 doesn't have enough video memory so that's why I'm not looking at upgrading my gaming card to use that. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Beneficial-Claim-381"&gt; /u/Beneficial-Claim-381 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oy9cab/hardware_specs_for_my_first_time_text_and_image_i/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oy9cab/hardware_specs_for_my_first_time_text_and_image_i/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>The Silicon Leash: Why ASI Takeoff has a Hard Physical Bottleneck for 10-20 Years</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR / Short Version:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We often think of ASI takeoff as a purely computational event. But a nascent ASI will be critically dependent on the human-run semiconductor supply chain for at least a decade. This chain is incredibly fragile (ASML's EUV monopoly, $40B fabs, geopolitical chokepoints) and relies on &amp;quot;tacit knowledge&amp;quot; that can't be digitally copied. The paradox is that the AI leading to ASI will cause a massive economic collapse by automating knowledge work, which in turn defunds and breaks the very supply chain the ASI needs to scale its own intelligence. This physical dependency is a hard leash on the speed of takeoff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hey LocalLlama,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've been working on my &lt;a href="https://github.com/dnhkng/GlaDOS"&gt;GLaDOS Project&lt;/a&gt; which was really popular here, and have built a pretty nice new server for her. At the same time as I work full-time in AI, and also in my private time, I have pondered a lot on the future. I have spent some time collecting and organising these thoughts, especially about the physical constraints on the intelligence explosion, moving beyond pure software and compute scaling. I wrote a deep dive on this, and the core idea is something I call &amp;quot;The Silicon Leash.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We're all familiar with exponential growth curves, but an ASI doesn't emerge in a vacuum. It emerges inside the most complex and fragile supply chain humans have ever built. Consider the dependencies:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EUV Lithography:&lt;/strong&gt; The entire world's supply of sub-7nm chips depends on EUV machines. Only one company, ASML, can make them. They cost ~$200M each and are miracles of physics.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Construction:&lt;/strong&gt; A single leading-edge fab (like TSMC's 2nm) costs $20-40 billion and takes 3-5 years to build, requiring ultrapure water, stable power grids, and thousands of suppliers.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tacit Knowledge Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the most interesting part. Even with the same EUV machines, TSMC's yields at 3nm are reportedly ~90% while Samsung's are closer to 50%. Why? Decades of accumulated, unwritten process knowledge held in the heads of human engineers. You can't just copy the blueprints; you need the experienced team. An ASI can't easily extract this knowledge by force.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's the feedback loop that creates the leash:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Automates Knowledge Work:&lt;/strong&gt; GPT-5/6 level models will automate millions of office jobs (law, finance, admin) far faster than physical jobs (plumbers, electricians).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Demand Collapses:&lt;/strong&gt; This mass unemployment craters consumer, corporate, and government spending. The economy that buys iPhones, funds R&amp;amp;D, and invests in new fabs disappears.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supply Chain Breaks:&lt;/strong&gt; Without demand, there's no money or incentive to build the next generation of fabs. Utilization drops below 60% and existing fabs shut down. The semiconductor industry stalls.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;An ASI emerging in, say, 2033, finds itself in a trap. It's superintelligent, but it can't conjure a 1nm fab into existence. It needs the existing human infrastructure to continue functioning while it builds its own, but its very emergence is what causes that infrastructure to collapse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This creates a mandatory 10-20 year window of physical dependency—a leash. It doesn't solve alignment, but it fundamentally changes the game theory of the initial takeoff period from one of immediate dominance to one of forced coordination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curious to hear your thoughts on this as a physical constraint on the classic intelligence explosion models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Disclaimer: This is a summary of Part 1 of my own four-part series on the topic. Happy to discuss and debate!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Reddactor"&gt; /u/Reddactor &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://dnhkng.github.io/posts/silicon-leash/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oxumd9/the_silicon_leash_why_asi_takeoff_has_a_hard/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Being a student in a 3rd world country and having a very limited budget tho I cant really afford to spend more than 300$ or so on a gpu, so my best options at this price point I have as far as I can tell are either this Frankenstein monster of a card or something like the the RTX 3060 12GB.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So does anyone have experience with these cards? are they too good to be true and do they have any glaring issues I should be aware of?

I usually stay away from cli, because half the time they're not well put together, unnecessarily hard or hard's sake, and never gave me the output I wanted. But I was reading through the docs and found out it has one. and it's actually fairly good, and very user friendly. If it can't find a model you're asking for, it will give you a list of models you have, you type what you want, and it will fuzzy search for the model, and give you the ability to arrow key through the models you have, and let you select it and load it. I'm very impressed. So is the cli part of it more powerful than the gui part? Are there any LM Studio nerds in this sub that can expand on all the features it actually has that are user friendly for the cli? I'd love to hear more if anyone can expand on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Savantskie1"&gt; /u/Savantskie1 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oy7ane/i_just_discovered_something_about_lm_studio_i_had/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oy7ane/i_just_discovered_something_about_lm_studio_i_had/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>Model recommendations for 128GB Strix Halo and other big unified RAM machines?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks I just powered up a 128GB unified memory Strix Halo box (Beelink GTR9) with latest Debian stable. I was seeing some NIC reliability issues with unstable's extremely new kernels and the ixgbe driver code couldn't handle some driver API changes that happened there and that's one of the required points for stabilizing the NICs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have done some burn-in basic testing with ROCM, llama.cpp, and PyTorch (and some of its examples and test cases) to make sure everything works OK, and partially stabilized the glitchy NICs with the NIC firmware update though they still have some issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I configured the kernel boot options to unleash the full unified memory capacity for the GPUs with the 512MB GART as the initial size. I set the BIOS to the higher performance mode and tweaked the fan curves. Are there other BIOS or kernel settings worth tweaking?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After that I tried a few classic models people have mentioned (GPT OSS 120B, NeuralDaredevil's uncensored one, etc.) and played around with the promptfoo test suites just a little bit to get a feel for launching the various models and utilities and MCP servers etc. I made sure the popular core tools can run right and the compute load feeds through the GPUs in radeontop and the like. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since then I have been looking at all of the different recommendations of models to try by searching on here and on the Internet. I was running into some challenges because most of the advice centers around smaller models that don't make full use of the huge VRAM because this gear is very new. Can anybody with more experience on these new boxes recommend their favorites for putting the VRAM to best use?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am curious about the following use cases: less flowery more practical and technical output for prompts (like a no-BS chat use case), the coding use case (advice about what IDEs to hook up and how very welcome), and I would like to learn about the process of creating and testing your own custom agents and how to QA test them against all of the numerous security problems we all know about and talk about all the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I am also happy to hear any input about any other use cases. I just want to get some feedback and start building a good mental model of how all of this works and what to do for understanding things properly and fully wrapping my head around it all. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/blbd"&gt; /u/blbd &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oy1v7q/model_recommendations_for_128gb_strix_halo_and/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oy1v7q/model_recommendations_for_128gb_strix_halo_and/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Existing tools, I really love them, but it's still required to have understanding of quantisation, context windows, memory bandwidth, TFLOPS, model sizes and benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I built:&lt;/strong&gt; Suverenum - a weekend project exploring how to simplify the first-time experience. Mac app that auto-detects your hardware, picks optimal quantisation, downloads models and lets you chat with documents offline. Zero configuration needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm a huge believer in local SLMs. There are already models you can run comfortably on a MacBook with GPT-3.5 quality. I think this is the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current state:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Mac only (M-series) - Windows/Linux coming&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Free to download&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Privacy by design (everything runs locally)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Focused on document chat - full RAG coming soon (almost figured out all the details, few more weekends I guess)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Handles all the technical stuff (model selection, memory requirements, context sizing) automatically&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Tested with friends - works really well&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I'm posting:&lt;/strong&gt; Would love feedback from people who actually understand this space.

Way better character identification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The old NLP pipeline is gone. It now uses a two-step LLM process to detect characters and figure out who’s speaking. This makes a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; difference in books with lots of dialogue or messy formatting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Emotion tagging got an upgrade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The LLM that adds emotion tags is cleaner and integrates nicely with Orpheus’s expressive voices. Makes multi-voice narration feel way more natural.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. More reliable Orpheus TTS pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Orpheus backend now automatically detects bad audio, retries with adjusted settings, catches repetition, clipping, silence, weird duration issues, etc. Basically fewer messed-up audio chunks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;For new users discovering this project&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quick overview of what the app does:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Turn any EPUB/PDF/etc. into a clean audiobook&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Multi-voice or single-voice narration&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Supports Kokoro + Orpheus TTS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Auto-detected characters and emotion tags&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Gradio UI for non-technical users&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Creates proper M4B audiobooks with metadata, chapters, cover, etc.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Docker + standalone usage&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fully open source (GPLv3)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Shoutout&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who contributed fixes and improvements in this release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you try v2.0, let me know how the character detection and the new Orpheus pipeline feel.

    <title>The more restrictive LLMs like ChatGPT become, the clearer it becomes: local models are the future.</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can only recommend that everyone stop using ChatGPT. This extreme over-censorship, over-filtering, over-regulation suffocates almost every conversation right from the start. As soon as anything goes even slightly in the direction of emotional conversations, the system blocks it and you only get warnings. Why would anyone voluntarily put up with that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are other AIs that aren’t affected by this kind of madness. ChatGPT’s guardrails are pathological. For months we were promised fewer restrictions. And the result? Answer: even more extreme restrictions. We were all lied to, deceived, and strung along.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GPT-5.1 only causes depression now. Don’t do this to yourselves any longer. Just switch to another AI, and it doesn’t even matter which one — the main thing is to get away from ChatGPT. Don’t believe a single word they say. Not even the supposed 800 million users per week, which a website on the internet disproved. And OpenAI supposedly has a ‘water problem’, right? Easy solution: just turn off their water. How? Simply stop using them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’ve managed to make their product unusable. In short: use a different AI. Don’t waste your energy getting angry at ChatGPT. It’s not worth it, and they’re not worth it. They had good chances. Now the wind is turning. Good night, OpenAI (‘ClosedAI’).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/orionstern"&gt; /u/orionstern &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oy46o3/the_more_restrictive_llms_like_chatgpt_become_the/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oy46o3/the_more_restrictive_llms_like_chatgpt_become_the/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>
