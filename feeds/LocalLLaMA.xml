    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr - are there any models that handle conflict in a realistic way? That is to say, characters in-fiction will refuse each other and behave somewhat rationally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've been playing around with AI as a writing assistant, essentially prompting it with what I have so far and seeing how it might complete a sentence/paragraph, change my description, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn't writing for sale, just for fun to see what I can do with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;setup is 2x 3090s&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AI rarely outright refuses me at the model level in the &amp;quot;can't let you do that Dave&amp;quot; sense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, I've encountered an issue I reckon many others have too - it sucks terribly at conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are there any models or finetunes or strategies that can get round this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, I can spend about 8000 words setting up a conflict between two ex-lovers who have despised each other for a decade, and the moment the AI takes the wheel it has them start to reconcile immediately and cry on each others shoulders within one page. All the models I've tried behave this way. Mistral, Qwen, Llama, some finetunes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even conversations that start about a completely different topic eventually devolve into &amp;quot;you know we should also address the thing while we're here.&amp;quot; like it's a Teams call performance review.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've tried prompting it to avoid easy conflict resolution in a variety of ways with mixed results, all bad. It will either outright ignore the prompt, or hyper fixate on it with no middle ground. So either characters still reconcile, or they become outright petty and start arguments no sane person would have while ignoring everything else in the scene's context.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/TurpentineEnjoyer"&gt; /u/TurpentineEnjoyer &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nkyvty/solutions_to_the_sycophant_problem/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nkyvty/solutions_to_the_sycophant_problem/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was having a lot of fun a few months back learning graph/vector based RAG. Then work unloaded a ridiculous level of work. I started by trying to use my ASUS M16 with a 4090 for local 3b models. It didn't work as I hoped. Now I'll probably sell the thing to build a local desktop rig that I can remotely use across the world (original reason I got the M16). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reason I want it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years I've taken it upon myself to start future proofing my career. I've learn IoT, game development, and now mostly LLMs. I want to also learn how to do things like object detection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a tax write off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I'm jobless I don't have to pay cloud costs and I have something I can liquidate if need be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would expand what I could do startup wise. &lt;strong&gt;(Most important reason)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;So my question is, what's the limit of one or two RTX 6000 Pro Blackwells? Would I be able to essentially do any RAG, Object detection, or ML like start up? What type of accuracy could I hope to accomplish with a good RAG pipeline and the open source models that'd be able to run on one or two of these GPUs? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Tired__Dev"&gt; /u/Tired__Dev &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nkpohe/i_can_can_get_gpus_as_a_tax_write_off_thinking_of/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nkpohe/i_can_can_get_gpus_as_a_tax_write_off_thinking_of/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I’m now eating crow. And willing to admit I was wrong in my last post about this model. In many cases with other models, I’ve had to be explicit about how the tools I made for my memory system works and proper tool execution. Apparently not so much with this model. Apparently the less you have in the prompt, the better it works. Before my prompts had to be at least 300 tokens or more. I decided I should try a simpler prompt that isn’t as explicit, and instead explained the reasons behind some of the more niche ones. And so far it’s been much better at using the tools. It was just me being an obstinate little jerk expecting the model to just understand what the tools were for. It’s been pretty good at calling them and proactive at their use. I feel like a moron. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Savantskie1"&gt; /u/Savantskie1 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nl7d70/figured_out_my_problem_with_gptoss20b/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nl7d70/figured_out_my_problem_with_gptoss20b/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;br /&gt; in past weeks I've been evaluating agentic coding setups on server with 6x 24 GB gpus (5x 3090 + 1x 4090). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'd like to have setup that will allow me to have inline completion (can be separate model) and agentic coder (crush, opencode, codex, ...). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inline completion isn't really issue I use &lt;a href="https://github.com/milanglacier/minuet-ai.nvim"&gt;https://github.com/milanglacier/minuet-ai.nvim&lt;/a&gt; and it just queries openai chat endpoint so if it works it works (almost any model will work with it).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Main issue is agentic coding. So far only setup that worked for me reliably is gpt-oss-120b with llama.cpp on 4x 3090 + codex. I've also tried gpt-oss-120b on vllm but there are tool calling issues when streaming (which is shame since it allows for multiple requests at once).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've also tried to evaluate (test cases and results here &lt;a href="https://github.com/hnatekmarorg/llm-eval/tree/main/output"&gt;https://github.com/hnatekmarorg/llm-eval/tree/main/output&lt;/a&gt; ) multiple models which are recommended here:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- qwen3-30b-* seems to exhibit tool calling issues both on vllm and llama.cpp but maybe I haven't found good client for it. Qwen3-30b-coder (in my tests its called qwen3-coder-plus since it worked with qwen client) seems ok but dumber (which is expected for 30b vs 60b model) than gpt-oss but it does create pretty frontend&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- gpt-oss-120b seems good enough but if there is something better I can run I am all ears&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- nemotron 49b is lot slower then gpt-oss-120b (expected since it isn't MoE) and for my use case doesn't seem better&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- glm-4.5-air seems to be strong contender but I haven't had luck with any of the clients I could test&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rest aren't that interesting I've also tried lower quants of qwen3-235b (I believe it was Q3) and it didn't seem worth it based on speed and quality of response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if you have recommendations on how to improve my setup (gpt-oss-120b for agentic + some smaller faster model for inline completions) let me know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also I should mention that I haven't really had time to test these thing comprehensively so if I missed something obvious I apologize in advance &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also if that inline completion model could fit into 8GB of VRAM I can run it on my notebook... (maybe something like smaller qwen2.5-coder with limited context wouldn't be a worst idea in the world)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Grouchy_Ad_4750"&gt; /u/Grouchy_Ad_4750 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nkw8v6/favorite_agentic_coding_llm_up_to_144gb_of_vram/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nkw8v6/favorite_agentic_coding_llm_up_to_144gb_of_vram/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>[Update] MonkeSearch x LEANN vector db: 97% less storage for semantic file search on your pc, locally.</title>
    <updated>2025-09-19T16:16:54+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! Been working on MonkeSearch for a while now and just shipped a major update that I'm pretty excited about. I collaborated with the team from LEANN to work on a cooler implementation of monkeSearch!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What changed:&lt;/strong&gt; Ditched the LLM-based approach and integrated LEANN (a vector DB with 2.6k stars on GitHub that uses graph-based selective recomputation). Collaborated with the LEANN team and contributed the implementation back to their repo too&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The numbers are wild, I have almost 5000 files in 6 folders I've defined in the code and the index size (recompute enabled) is &amp;gt;40Kbs and with recompute disabled it is &amp;gt;15 MB. Yes, all of the files on my pc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it does:&lt;/strong&gt; Natural language search for your files with temporal awareness. Type &amp;quot;documents from last week&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;photos from around 3 days ago&amp;quot; and it actually understands what you mean. Uses Spotlight metadata on macOS, builds a semantic index with LEANN, and filters results based on time expressions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why LEANN matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of storing all embeddings (expensive), it stores a pruned graph and recomputes embeddings on-demand during search. You get the same search quality while using 97% less storage. Your entire file index fits in memory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The temporal parsing is regex-based now (no more LLM overhead), and search happens through semantic similarity instead of keyword matching. Also to note, that only file metadata is indexed for now, not the content. But we can have a multi model system in the future comprising of VLM/ Audio models to tag images with context and embed into the db etc. so that the search gets even better, and everything running locally (trying to keep VRAM requirements to the minimum, aiming at even potato pcs without GPUs)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still a prototype and macOS-only for now, but it's actually usable. Everything's open source if you want to peek at the implementation or help with Windows/Linux support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vector DB approach (main branch):&lt;/strong&gt; File metadata gets embedded once, stored in LEANN's graph structure, and searched semantically. Temporal expressions like &amp;quot;documents from last week&amp;quot; are parsed via regex, no LLM overhead. Sub-second search on hundreds of thousands of files.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The direct LLM approach (alternate branch):&lt;/strong&gt; For those who prefer simplicity over storage efficiency, there's an implementation where an LLM directly queries macOS Spotlight. No index building, no embeddings - just natural language to Spotlight predicates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both implementations are open source and designed to plug into larger systems. Whether you're building RAG pipelines, local AI assistants, or automation tools, having semantic file search that runs entirely offline changes what's possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If all of this sounds interesting, check out the repo: ﻿﻿&lt;a href="https://github.com/monkesearch/monkeSearch/"&gt;https://github.com/monkesearch/monkeSearch/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;LEANN repo: &lt;a href="https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN"&gt;https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/fuckAIbruhIhateCorps"&gt; /u/fuckAIbruhIhateCorps &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nl7ymi/update_monkesearch_x_leann_vector_db_97_less/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nl7ymi/update_monkesearch_x_leann_vector_db_97_less/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

I do scientific coding stuff, not web or application development related stuff, so the needs might be different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deployed on a 48gb Mac, but this should work on 32GB, and maybe even 24GB setups:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;General Tasks, used 90% of the time: Cline on top of Qwen3Coder-30b-a3b. Served by LM Studio in MLX format for maximum speed. This is the backbone of everything else...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Difficult single script tasks, 5% of the time: QwenCode on top of GPT-OSS 20b (Reasoning effort: High). Served by LM Studio. This cannot be served at the same time of Qwen3Coder due to lack of RAM. The problem cracker. GPT-OSS can be swept with other reasoning models with tool use capabilities (Magistral, DeepSeek, ERNIE-thinking, EXAONE, etc... lot of options here)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experimental, hand-made prototyping: Continue doing auto-complete work on top of Qwen2.5-Coder 7b. Served by Ollama to be always available together with the model served by LM Studio. When you need to be in the loop of creativity this is the one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IDE for data exploration: Spyder&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Long Live to Local LLM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 0: How to setup this thing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Get LM Studio installed (specially if you have a Mac since you can run MLX). Ollama and Llama.cpp will be faster if you are on windows, but you will need to learn about model setup, custom model setup... not difficult, but one more thing to worry about. With LM studio set up model defaults for context and inference parameters is just super easy. If you use Linux... well you probably already now what to do regarding LLM local serving.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;1.1. On LM Studio set the context length of your LLMs to 131072. QwenCode might not need that much, but Cline for sure. No need to set it to 265K for QwenCoder: too much ram needs, too slow to run as it fills that up... it's likely you can get this to work with 32K or 16K 🤔 I need to test that...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1.2. Recommended LLMs: I favor MoE because they run fast on my machine, but the overall consensus is that Dense models are just smarter. But for most of the work what you want is speed and break your big tasks into smaller and easier little tasks, so MoE speed triumphs over Dense knowledge:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MoE models:&lt;br /&gt; qwen/qwen3-coder-30b ( great for Cline)&lt;br /&gt; basedbase-qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct-480b-distill-v2-fp32 (Great for Cline)&lt;br /&gt; openai/gpt-oss-20b (This one works GREAT on QwenCode with Thinking effort set to High)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dense models (slower than MoE, but actually kind of better results if you let them working over night, or don't mind to wait):&lt;br /&gt; mistralai/devstral-small-2507&lt;br /&gt; mistralai/magistral-small-2509&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get VS code, add the Cline and QwenCode extension.

The VRAM clock does not change with the different power limits and always stays almost at its maximum value of 14001 MHz, but the GPU clock varies. And the most interesting chart is &amp;quot;minutes elapsed vs energy consumed&amp;quot; chart: the &lt;code&gt;llama-bench&lt;/code&gt; takes the same time to complete the task (process/generate 1024 tokens for 5 times), and the GPU just wastes more energy with the higher power limits. It appeared that I was wrong with the conclusion that 360W is the best power limit for PRO 6000: the actual best spot seems to be around 310W (the actual power draw should be around 290W).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also people recommend to downvolt the GPU instead of power limiting it, for example see these threads:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nhcf8t/successfully_tuning_5090s_for_low_heat_high_speed/"&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nhcf8t/successfully_tuning_5090s_for_low_heat_high_speed/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1njlnad/lact_indirect_undervolt_oc_method_beats_nvidiasmi/"&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1njlnad/lact_indirect_undervolt_oc_method_beats_nvidiasmi/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did not run the proper tests yet but from the quick testing it seems that raising the power limit plus limiting the GPU clock MHz indeed works better than simply lowering the power limit. I will run a similar test with DCGM but limiting the clock instead of the power, and will report back later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems that downvolting or downclocking the GPU yields higher TG (but lower PP) throughput at the same power draw than a simple power limiting. For example downclocking the GPU to 1000 MHz gives 1772 PP, 37.3 TG at ~310 W power draw, and power limiting the GPU to 330W gives 2102.26 PP (~400 t/s higher), 36.0 TG (1 t/s lower) at the same ~310 W power draw. I'd prefer 1 t/s faster TG than ~400 t/s faster PP because PP above 1000 t/s is fast enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please note that test results might be affected by cold starting the model each time, you might want to recheck again without flushing the RAM. Also a &lt;code&gt;--no-warmup&lt;/code&gt; option of llama-bench might be needed. And in the end there might be a better testing suite than a simple &lt;code&gt;llama-bench&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is the testing script I've made (slightly modified and not rechecked prior to posting to Reddit so I might have fucked it up, check the code before running it), has to be run as root.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash gpuname=' PRO 6000 '; # search the GPU id by this string startpower=150; # Watt endpower=600; # Watt increment=30; # Watt llama_bench='/path/to/bin/llama-bench'; model='/path/to/Qwen_Qwen3-32B-Q8_0.gguf';

Unlike traditional audio models requiring task-specific fine-tuning, MiMo-Audio generalizes to new audio tasks with just a few examples or simple instructions - just like humans do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Philosophy:&lt;/strong&gt; Successfully applying GPT-3's next-token prediction paradigm to the audio domain, achieving strong generalization through large-scale pretraining.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;🔧 Core Technical Architecture&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Dual-Component Design&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MiMo-Audio-Tokenizer (1.2B parameters)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;: 25Hz Transformer&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Features&lt;/strong&gt;: 8-layer RVQ (Residual Vector Quantization) stack&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt;: 200 tokens/second generation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training Data&lt;/strong&gt;: 10 million hours audio corpus&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimization&lt;/strong&gt;: Joint semantic and reconstruction objectives&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MiMo-Audio-7B (7B parameters)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;: Qwen2-based language model&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovative Design&lt;/strong&gt;: Patch encoder + LLM + patch decoder&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patch Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;: Aggregates 4 consecutive RVQ token timesteps into single patches&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sequence Compression&lt;/strong&gt;: Downsamples from 25Hz to 6.25Hz for modeling efficiency&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generation Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;: Delayed generation scheme with autoregressive full 25Hz sequence&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Key Technical Innovations&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patch Aggregation Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;: Solves high-frequency sequence modeling efficiency&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semantic-Reconstruction Joint Optimization&lt;/strong&gt;: Balances audio quality and semantic understanding&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delayed Generation Scheme&lt;/strong&gt;: Balances generation quality and computational efficiency&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chain-of-Thought Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;: Introduces thinking mode in instruction-tuned version&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we first started building with LLMs, the gap was obvious: they could reason well in the moment, but forgot everything as soon as the conversation moved on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You could tell an agent, &lt;em&gt;“I don’t like coffee,”&lt;/em&gt; and three steps later it would suggest espresso again. It wasn’t broken logic, it was missing memory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, people have tried a bunch of ways to fix it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt stuffing / fine-tuning&lt;/strong&gt; – Keep prepending history. Works for short chats, but tokens and cost explode fast.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vector databases (RAG)&lt;/strong&gt; – Store embeddings in Pinecone/Weaviate. Recall is semantic, but retrieval is noisy and loses structure.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graph databases&lt;/strong&gt; – Build entity-relationship graphs. Great for reasoning, but hard to scale and maintain.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid systems&lt;/strong&gt; – Mix vectors, graphs, key-value, and relational DBs. Flexible but complex.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then there’s the twist:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Relational databases! Yes,&lt;/strong&gt; the tech that’s been running banks and social media for decades is looking like one of the most practical ways to give AI persistent memory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of exotic stores, you can:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Keep short-term vs long-term memory in SQL tables&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Store entities, rules, and preferences as structured records&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Promote important facts into permanent memory&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use joins and indexes for retrieval&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the approach we’ve been working on at &lt;strong&gt;Gibson&lt;/strong&gt;. We built an open-source project called &lt;a href="https://github.com/gibsonai/memori"&gt;Memori&lt;/a&gt; , a &lt;strong&gt;multi-agent memory engine&lt;/strong&gt; that gives your AI agents human-like memory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s kind of ironic, after all the hype around vectors and graphs, one of the best answers to AI memory might be the tech we’ve trusted for 50+ years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would love to know your thoughts about our approach!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Arindam_200"&gt; /u/Arindam_200 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nkwx12/everyones_trying_vectors_and_graphs_for_ai_memory/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nkwx12/everyones_trying_vectors_and_graphs_for_ai_memory/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Thank you for having us here today. We got a full house from the LM Studio team: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- Yags &lt;a href="https://t.co/ERfA4NrR96"&gt;https://reddit.com/user/yags-lms/&lt;/a&gt; (founder)&lt;br /&gt; - Neil &lt;a href="https://t.co/KyiHVfv0QG"&gt;https://reddit.com/user/neilmehta24/&lt;/a&gt; (LLM engines and runtime)&lt;br /&gt; - Will &lt;a href="https://t.co/IjAZJL2JMK"&gt;https://reddit.com/user/will-lms/&lt;/a&gt; (LLM engines and runtime)&lt;br /&gt; - Matt &lt;a href="https://t.co/6MNkItPYnI"&gt;https://reddit.com/user/matt-lms/&lt;/a&gt; (LLM engines, runtime, and APIs)&lt;br /&gt; - Ryan &lt;a href="https://t.co/0snuNUPizo"&gt;https://reddit.com/user/ryan-lms/&lt;/a&gt; (Core system and APIs)&lt;br /&gt; - Rugved &lt;a href="https://t.co/xGtYHsJZI3"&gt;https://reddit.com/user/rugved_lms/&lt;/a&gt; (CLI and SDKs)&lt;br /&gt; - Alex &lt;a href="https://t.co/wtT2IFf0z6"&gt;https://reddit.com/user/alex-lms/&lt;/a&gt; (App)&lt;br /&gt; - Julian &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/julian-lms/"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/user/julian-lms/&lt;/a&gt; (Ops) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Excited to chat about: the latest local models, UX for local models, steering local models effectively, LM Studio SDK and APIs, how we support multiple LLM engines (llama.cpp, MLX, and more), privacy philosophy, why local AI matters, our open source projects (mlx-engine, lms, lmstudio-js, lmstudio-python, venvstacks), why ggerganov and Awni are the GOATs, where is TheBloke, and more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would love to hear about people's setup, which models you use, use cases that really work, how you got into local AI, what needs to improve in LM Studio and the ecosystem as a whole, how you use LM Studio, and anything in between!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone: it was awesome to see your questions here today and share replies! Thanks a lot for the welcoming AMA. We will continue to monitor this post for more questions over the next couple of days, but for now we're signing off to continue building 🔨&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have several marquee features we've been working on for a loong time coming out later this month that we hope you'll love and find lots of value in. And don't worry, UI for n cpu moe is on the way too :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Special shoutout and thanks to ggerganov, Awni Hannun, TheBloke, Hugging Face, and all the rest of the open source AI community!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you and see you around! - Team LM Studio 👾&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/yags-lms"&gt; /u/yags-lms &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nkft9l/ama_with_the_lm_studio_team/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nkft9l/ama_with_the_lm_studio_team/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>
