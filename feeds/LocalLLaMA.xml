This lead to classic literary passages being enslopped. I then reversed this pipeline, and trained a model to go from [slop] -&amp;gt; [original]. The resulting model is capable enough to fool Pangram (a fairly robust AI detector - I take this as a metric of how 'human-sounding' the output is), at very little overall quality cost:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/go88234vifdg1.png?width=2817&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fed2c84e748f4441648e9f53c891258d78ccbb0a"&gt;While quality decreases slightly, humanness jumps from 0 to 0.481. The unslopped version stays firmly above Mistral Large 3 and close to the original GPT-5.2 baseline.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, the model is OSS: &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/N8Programs/Unslopper-30B-A3B-bf16"&gt;https://huggingface.co/N8Programs/Unslopper-30B-A3B-bf16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And there are now GGUFs: &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/N8Programs/Unslopper-GGUF"&gt;https://huggingface.co/N8Programs/Unslopper-GGUF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And there is a twitter thread (complete with 'thread below 👇', ironic in a thread about slop): &lt;a href="https://x.com/N8Programs/status/2011591738591494625"&gt;https://x.com/N8Programs/status/2011591738591494625&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goal here is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to fool Pangram, deceive/cheat, etc. I only use Pangram as a proxy for the prose being more readable - ideally, you'd use this model to make your own AI-generated passages more palatable to read, or as part of a larger pipeline in automated writing generation for training, for instance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Example (GPT-5.2):&lt;br /&gt; The wind rose all at once, as if the mountain itself had inhaled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She stood at the edge of the pass, cloak snapping like a torn banner behind her, staring down at the valley where the last lights were going out one by one. Each flame extinguished felt deliberate—an answer to a question she had been too afraid to ask. Somewhere below, bells began to ring, not in warning, but in mourning. They already knew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Don’t,” he said, breathless, reaching for her arm. His fingers brushed fabric, then air. “If you cross that line, there’s no coming back.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She didn’t turn. The cold burned her lungs, sharpened her thoughts. “There was never a way back,” she replied softly. “Only a way forward you were willing to pretend didn’t exist.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thunder rolled, low and ancient. For a moment, the sky fractured into white fire, and in that instant he saw her face—resolved, terrified, incandescent with purpose. Not the girl he had sworn to protect, but the woman the world had demanded she become.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You’ll die,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She smiled then, finally facing him, eyes bright with unshed tears. “So will everyone,” she answered. “The difference is what we leave burning when we’re gone.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She stepped forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mountain exhaled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pangram Verdict:&lt;/strong&gt; High Confidence AI Generated&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unslopped (Temp=0.8, Rep Penalty=1.1, 6-bit MLX quant):&lt;br /&gt; And then it just happened. Like the whole of reality had been held breathless for a moment, and suddenly sprang into focus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She stood at the pass's edge. Her cloak flapped behind her like a banner carried to its last stop. She was looking down into the valley, at lights being snuffed out one by one. Each flame extinguished was a point of answer to questions she had dared not ask. And now bells were ringing, not a signal but a dirge, because they already knew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please,&amp;quot; he said. He reached for her; his hand closed on the snaking line of fabric that trailed behind her, then nothing. &amp;quot;You can't cross over.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She didn't turn to him. It was cold enough to bite at her throat; she breathed it in, sharp and full of poison. &amp;quot;There was never a way out,&amp;quot; she said softly. &amp;quot;Only the road in that you did not want to remember.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A low rumble of thunder, older than mountains, filled the air. A white flash lit up the sky for a moment, a vivid static song of fire that illuminated her face in an instant. It was no longer the girl he'd sworn to protect, but the woman she had become.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You'll die.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She smiled at him and turned toward him. There were tears on her face, but they did not fall. &amp;quot;We all do,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;The difference is what we leave behind us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She started walking toward the edge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it all happened at once. The mountain exhaled itself, and took her with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pangram Verdict:&lt;/strong&gt; High Confidence Human Written&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that there are some local coherence issues w/ the Unslopper - that's why I'd recommend integrating it into a larger pipeline or editing its output yourself. It's definitely not production ready.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;---------&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a bonus, the training of this model was entirely local! Done on one M3 Max w/ mlx-lm. Took 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/N8Karma"&gt; /u/N8Karma &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qd88v2/i_trained_a_model_to_unslop_ai_prose/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qd88v2/i_trained_a_model_to_unslop_ai_prose/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

It's an Intel Ultra 9 285k with a 420mm AIO (front), an MSI Suprim LC 5090 with a 360mm AIO (top), and an RTX Pro 4500 32GB. 1300W platinum power supply and Aorus Master. 192GB RAM (4x48GB). Samsung 9100 Pro 8TB NVMe PCIe5. Intake fans on the back. Phanteks case was super easy to work with. I used Gemini Thinking to check compatibility on all of the parts before I ordered, and everything snapped together in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's nice to leave a model loaded in the Pro GPU, and leave the consumer GPU dedicated for video and games. No need to unload the model when you want to do something else. The Pro GPU idles at 2-3 watts with the model loaded, and spikes up to 150W when you feed it a prompt. The consumer GPU idles at 35W just to run the display, and 29C with the cooler running silently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had wanted a used L4, L40S, or A100 40GB but didn't trust the eBay rebuilds from China that were 50% cheaper than US/Canada items. The RTX Pro 4500 was a better choice for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Runs GPT OSS 120B about 30 tok/sec (doesn't fit) and GPT OSS 20B at &amp;gt;200 tok/sec.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/ck7tq2bjamdg1.jpg?width=4284&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=00e0028c7ade881c208d2a87f8ee6ac46a4c553b"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ck7tq2bjamdg1.jpg?width=4284&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=00e0028c7ade881c208d2a87f8ee6ac46a4c553b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/gwestr"&gt; /u/gwestr &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qe2ugl/gamingai_pc_build/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qe2ugl/gamingai_pc_build/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <title>Framework Desktop vs. 5090 for code analysis</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need opinions on what hardware to get, between Framework Desktop (AMD Stryx Halo 128GB unified RAM) and self-built PC with Nvidia 5090 32GB VRAM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The use case is somewhat peculiar. I will be working with still copyrighted vintage code, mostly for early x86 PC but some of it for other 80s/90s platforms. Mostly in C89 and some of it in 8086 and 68k assembly. I'm far from an expert in this and I will be working alone. I need an AI assistant for code analysis and expediting the learning process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am really not sure how to approach this. I have no experience with local models and don't know what to expect from either option. My worries are that AMD will be slow and 32gb in 5090 might not be enough. In theory, slow is better that nothing, I guess. As long as it's not unbearably slow. The price, form factor and cost of operating are also leaning in AMD's favor. But in any case, I don't want to spent thousands for a doorstop if it can't do the job. Anybody who has experience with this, is most welcome to express their opinion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm not even sure if LLMs are even capable of handling this somewhat obscure code base. But what I have tested with ChatGPT and Claude Code free models handle vintage C and assembly pretty well. But those are commercial cloud solutions, so yeah.... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am also open to suggestions on which local LLM is the most suitable for this kind of work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Albedo101"&gt; /u/Albedo101 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qdroja/framework_desktop_vs_5090_for_code_analysis/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qdroja/framework_desktop_vs_5090_for_code_analysis/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

And it really helps you understand what goes into an LM. I’ve gotten basically gibberish, in fact the most coherent thing the model has produced so far was to the prompt, “There once was a man” to which the model replied, “a maned ined” so… nothing really yet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BUT that’s the fun part. Just learning and playing with this thing and feeding it more open sourced data. I’ll post more updates in the future if I ever get past the model just randomly stringing together tokens!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/AllTheCoins"&gt; /u/AllTheCoins &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qdt76f/starting_my_own_model_journey/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qdt76f/starting_my_own_model_journey/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

I was wondering what sort of approach I should take with this and whether it makes more sense to develop a local or cloud tool. Also the information needs to be secured so that's why I was leaving toward local. Have software exp in other things but not working with LLMs or RAG systems so looking for pointers. Also turnkey tools are out of the picture unless they're close to 100k. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Next-Self-184"&gt; /u/Next-Self-184 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qdyc3e/job_wants_me_to_develop_rag_search_engine_for/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qdyc3e/job_wants_me_to_develop_rag_search_engine_for/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

When I first released Soprano, I had no idea how much support I would get from the community. Within the first day, I received an enormous number PRs adding onto the codebase. I have finally merged most of them, and am happy to announce that you can now run Soprano on nearly any device, and with a wide number of supported inference methods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of all the contributions you guys have made:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WebUI: (from Mateusz-Dera &amp;amp; humair-m)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;soprano-webui &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;CLI: (from bigattichouse)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;soprano &amp;quot;Hello world!&amp;quot; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;OpenAI-compatible endpoint (from bezo97)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;uvicorn soprano.server:app &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, several of you have made your own modifications to Soprano, allowing for ONNX and ComfyUI support! Here are some repos that implement this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/SanDiegoDude/ComfyUI-Soprano-TTS"&gt;https://github.com/SanDiegoDude/ComfyUI-Soprano-TTS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/jo-nike/ComfyUI-SopranoTTS"&gt;https://github.com/jo-nike/ComfyUI-SopranoTTS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/KevinAHM/soprano-web-onnx"&gt;https://github.com/KevinAHM/soprano-web-onnx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soprano also supports more than just CUDA devices now, too! It also supports CPU (from bigattichouse), MPS (from visionik), and there is an ROCm PR (from Mateusz-Dera) that can be found here:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ekwek1/soprano/pull/29"&gt;https://github.com/ekwek1/soprano/pull/29&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have an ROCm device I would love some help for testing this PR!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to thank the countless other contributions to Soprano, including an automatic hallucination detector from ChangeTheConstants and transformers streaming support from sheerun. You all have improved Soprano tremendously!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will likely be my last update for a bit, since I still have some unfinished business left on the roadmap that will take some time. I’m not abandoning you guys though! New capabilities for Soprano will be coming soon. :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- Eugene&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/eugenekwek"&gt; /u/eugenekwek &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.redd.it/581sfa20ojdg1.png"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qdpb2v/thanks_to_you_guys_soprano_tts_now_supports/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia has essentially killed off supply for the RTX 5070 Ti. Also supply of RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB has been significantly reduced. This happened partially due to memory supply shortages. This means that most AIBs will no longer manufacture these GPUs. Prices are already jumping significantly. The 5070 Ti has risen ~$100 over MSRP, and retailers expect further hikes. 8 GB configuration of RTX 5060 Ti remains unaffected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Credit: Hardware Unboxed &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE"&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Paramecium_caudatum_"&gt; /u/Paramecium_caudatum_ &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qdh28f/rtx_5070_ti_and_rtx_5060_ti_16_gb_no_longer/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qdh28f/rtx_5070_ti_and_rtx_5060_ti_16_gb_no_longer/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Cancelled the order and payed the premium for Azerty's model in stock (600EU), but it arrived the next day!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if you're in the Netherlands, I recommend calling up the store to ask about stock availability in advance. The listings on Tweakers wasn't accurate for this card.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today the announcement from HardwareUnboxed came that the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is becoming unavailable.

So I had the case, fans, AIO, 64 GB DDR5, motherboard, PSU, and 3080 (upgraded to 5070ti RIP). I was going to sell these parts, but I started running models on my 5070ti and eventually I wanted to start running larger models. I found a 3090 on eBay for $680, and 7950x for $350. I put that together with the parts and it’s been a great AI rig for me. I really didn’t plan on upgrading this for a while, especially now with the current price surges. Welp, I saw an A100 get listed for $1000 on eBay. The catch? Listed for parts, and the description just said “card reports CUDA error”. So I figured it was worth the risk (for me), I could’ve probably sold it for the price I paid. Well, I swapped out the 3080 and on the first boot it was recognized instantly by nvidia-smi. I was able to run and train models immediately. Nice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/inserterikhere"&gt; /u/inserterikhere &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.redd.it/f66wnmearldg1.jpeg"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qe0cxc/latest_upgradea100_40_gb/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

The subreddit has grown to 500k users - inevitably, some users like a niche community with more technical discussion and fewer memes (even if relevant).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have a discord bot to test out open source models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better contest and events organization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Best for quick questions or showcasing your rig!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/HOLUPREDICTIONS"&gt; /u/HOLUPREDICTIONS &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mpk2va"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mpk2va/announcing_localllama_discord_server_bot/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>
