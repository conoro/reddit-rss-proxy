    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the last month trying to move a multi-agent workflow from working on my machine to an actual production environment &amp;amp; I feel like I'm losing my mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The issue is not the models (Llama 3/Claude are fine). the issue is the plumbing. I'm using standard infra (AWS/Postgres) and standard agent frameworks (LangChain/CrewAI), but they feel like they hate each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;My agents keep losing state/context because standard containers are stateless.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Debugging a loop that ran up $50 in tokens is impossible because my logs don't match the agent's &amp;quot;thought process.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I am writing more glue code to manage connections and timeouts than actual agent logic.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m seriously considering building a dedicated runtime/hybrid platform just to handle this—basically merging the infra primitives (db or auth) directly with the orchestration so I don't have to manage them separately. Think of it like a stateful container specifically for agents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Has anyone else solved this? Or am I just overcomplicating the stack? I’m thinking of hacking together an open-source prototype. If I put it on GitHub, would anyone actually care to try it, or are you guys happy with the current tools?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Substantial_Guide_34"&gt; /u/Substantial_Guide_34 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p94hun/why_is_productionizing_agents_such_a_nightmare/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p94hun/why_is_productionizing_agents_such_a_nightmare/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been experimenting with browser-based local agents and one limitation keeps showing up: payments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Agents can automate workflows, call tools and fetch data, but the moment a payment is required, everything breaks because credit cards and human logins don’t work for autonomous software.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve been testing an early approach that uses wallet-native payments for agents inside browser-based local workflows. It’s still early, but it’s interesting to see how agents could eventually pay for APIs, data or services on their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wrote a short technical breakdown here for anyone interested in the architecture and flow:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;👉 &lt;a href="https://blog.shinkai.com/from-chat-to-commerce-how-agents-use-x402-in-shinkai/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://blog.shinkai.com/from-chat-to-commerce-how-agents-use-x402-in-shinkai/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Wide-Extension-750"&gt; /u/Wide-Extension-750 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p94kxo/exploring_walletnative_payments_for_browserbased/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p94kxo/exploring_walletnative_payments_for_browserbased/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

In my previous post, I got a lot of requests to attempt this derestricting on OpenAI's gpt-oss models as they are models that are intelligent but was infamous for being very...restricted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I thought that it would be a big challenge and be interesting to try and attempt as well, and so that was the next model I decided to try and derestrict next. The 120b version is more unwieldy to transfer around and load in/out of VRAM/RAM as I was experimenting, so I started with the 20b version first but I will get to the 120b next which should be super interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for the 20b model here, it seems to have worked! The model now can respond to questions that OpenAI never would have approved of answering (lol!). It also seems to have cut down its wasteful looping around of deciding whether it can or cannot answer a question based on a non existent policy in it's reasoning, although this isn't completely removed yet. I suspect a more customized harmful/harmless dataset to specifically target this behavior might be useful for this, so that will be what I need to work on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Otherwise I think this is just an outright improved model over the original as it is much more useful now than it's original behavior. Where it would usually flag a lot of false positives and be absolutely useless in certain situations just because of &amp;quot;safety&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to work on modifying the weights of the model, I also had to use a BF16 converted version to start with as the model as you all might know was released in MXFP4 format, but then attempting the ablation on the BF16 converted model seems to work well. I think that this proves that this new method of essentially &amp;quot;direction-based&amp;quot; abliteration is really flexible and works super well for probably any models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for quants, I'm not one to worry about making GGUFs myself because I'm sure the GGUF makers will get to it pretty fast and do a better job than I can. Also, there are no FP8 or INT8 quants now because its pretty small and those that run FP8 or INT8 quants usually have a substantial GPU setup anyways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try it out and have fun! This time it's really for &lt;a href="/r/LocalLLaMA"&gt;r/LocalLLaMA&lt;/a&gt; because we don't even run this model on our Arli AI API service.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Arli_AI"&gt; /u/Arli_AI &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/ArliAI/gpt-oss-20b-Derestricted"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p81k2z/yes_it_is_possible_to_uncensor_gptoss20b/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

(Link to Chat with the Model provided)" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From the Official Announcement:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, we release INTELLECT-3, a 100B+ parameter Mixture-of-Experts model trained on our RL stack, achieving state-of-the-art performance for its size across math, code, science and reasoning benchmarks, outperforming many larger frontier models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our complete recipe — from the model weights and training frameworks, to our datasets, RL environments, and evaluations — has been open-sourced, with the goal of encouraging more open research on large scale reinforcement learning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;INTELLECT-3 is trained on the same software and infrastructure that we’re open-sourcing and making available on our platform at Prime Intellect, giving everyone the tools to post-train their own state-of-the-art models, and moving us towards a future where every company can be an AI company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sharpest distinction between Prime-RL and many other RL trainers is that it is async-only — we recognized fairly early (for our previous INTELLECT-2 model) that the future of RL is async; i.e. always a few steps off-policy. Async training is simply the only practical way to efficiently scale RL to long-horizon agentic rollouts without incurring bottlenecks based on the slowest rollouts per step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Architecture:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three main abstractions facilitate RL training: the orchestrator, the trainer, and the inference service. A RL training run involves the coordination of a trainer, orchestrator and an inference service. The FSDP trainer and vLLM inference run disaggregated, and can be individually deployed across multiple nodes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orchestrator:&lt;/strong&gt; - The orchestrator is a lightweight CPU process that handles the core data flow and scheduling logic, serving as an intermediary between the trainer and inference service with bidirectional relays. In one direction, it collects rollouts from the inference server, assembles them into packed batches, and dispatches them to the trainer; in the other direction, it relays updated model weights from the trainer to the inference service. The orchestrator utilizes verifiers environments to abstract multi-turn rollout generation and scoring, allowing any environment on the Environments Hub to plug into the training loop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trainer:&lt;/strong&gt; - The trainer is responsible for producing an updated policy model given rollouts and advantages. We use FSDP 2 as the backend with compatibility for any HuggingFace model. FSDP shards model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states, allowing training large models with data parallelism and minimal GPU memory footprint. The trainer is inspired by torchtitan and relies on native PyTorch features to implement advanced parallelism techniques, such as tensor, context, and expert parallelism, and leverages grouped matrix multiplication kernels for efficient MoE training.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inference:&lt;/strong&gt; - The inference pool consists of standard OpenAI-compatible servers with a vLLM backend. The API specification is extended with custom endpoints to enable updating the server with the latest policy: &lt;code&gt;/update_weights&lt;/code&gt; is used to update the policy, and &lt;code&gt;/reload_weights&lt;/code&gt; is used to reset the weights to the base model in between experiments. We rely on vLLM's optimized kernels, parallelism strategies, and scheduling for fast rollout generation. Given the disaggregated nature of the service architecture, it can be directly extended to include multiple engines with a shared request pool, allowing operation across multiple clusters and straightforward integration of alternative inference engines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Link to the Official Announcement: &lt;a href="https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/intellect-3"&gt;https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/intellect-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Link to the Technical Report: &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/intellect-3-paper/INTELLECT_3_Technical_Report.pdf"&gt;https://storage.googleapis.com/intellect-3-paper/INTELLECT_3_Technical_Report.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Link to the Open-Sourced Prime-RL GitHub: &lt;a href="https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl"&gt;https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Link to the Open-Sourced Model Weights: &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/PrimeIntellect/INTELLECT-3"&gt;https://huggingface.co/PrimeIntellect/INTELLECT-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Chat with the Model Here: &lt;a href="https://chat.primeintellect.ai/"&gt;https://chat.primeintellect.ai/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/44th--Hokage"&gt; /u/44th--Hokage &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p8ahy8"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p8ahy8/prime_intellect_introduces_intellect3_a_100b_moe/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

A lot of folks in the comments asked for a clearer side-by-side comparison with LiteLLM, including performance benchmarks and migration examples. So here’s a follow-up that lays out the numbers, features, and how to switch over in one line of code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benchmarks (vs LiteLLM)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Setup:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;single t3.medium instance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;mock llm with 1.5 seconds latency&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th align="left"&gt;Metric&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="left"&gt;LiteLLM&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="left"&gt;Bifrost&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th align="left"&gt;Improvement&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left" colspan="3"&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;p99 Latency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;90.72s&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;1.68s&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;~54× faster&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Throughput&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;44.84 req/sec&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;424 req/sec&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;~9.4× higher&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;372MB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;120MB&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;~3× lighter&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mean Overhead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;~500µs&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11µs @ 5K RPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;~45× lower&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repo:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost"&gt;https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Key Highlights&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-low overhead:&lt;/strong&gt; mean request handling overhead is just &lt;strong&gt;11µs per request&lt;/strong&gt; at 5K RPS.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provider Fallback:&lt;/strong&gt; Automatic failover between providers ensures 99.99% uptime for your applications.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semantic caching:&lt;/strong&gt; deduplicates similar requests to reduce repeated inference costs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive load balancing:&lt;/strong&gt; Automatically optimizes traffic distribution across provider keys and models based on real-time performance metrics.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cluster mode resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; High availability deployment with automatic failover and load balancing.

    <title>How many parameters do you think are required to emulate the *knowledge* of an average person</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not controversial to state that LLMs today aren't 100% efficient in their parameter usage. It would not surprise me if we could compress current day performance into one hundredth of the parameters. That said, all knowledge requires &lt;em&gt;information,&lt;/em&gt; and there must therefore be a limit to the level of compression that can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The current paradigm tries to train all LLMs as generalists for various technical reasons I'm sure I don't have to explain to the people here. This means that basically all LLMs, even those with only a couple of billion parameters, speak passable Norwegian, for example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say we narrowed the scope and instead of trying to build generalists, we tried to build an LLM with an amount of knowledge comparable to that of an average person. Let's make the person monolingual, with the common knowledge expected of any modern person, and an expert in a single field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let's also ignore vision, real-world navigation, and actually processing the knowledge, as these seem a bit too vague to reliably get an estimate of at the moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Feels like a fair few of the responders didn't understand the question😅. This discussion is meant as a purely academic exercise for the theoretical lower limit of number of parameters required for the knowledge of an average person. I.e. not intelligence, just the pure amount of information required to represent the an average person's knowledge. I've seen a few people comment that LLMs have surpassed us on this already. I agree with this, I think we could easily represent it with far fewer parameters than the current SotA LLMs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/FrostTactics"&gt; /u/FrostTactics &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p8pcrj/how_many_parameters_do_you_think_are_required_to/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p8pcrj/how_many_parameters_do_you_think_are_required_to/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Different models degrade slightly differently, but the PATTERN holds - math breaks way faster than other tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why this matters: If you're using a model for coding or math, Q4 might seem fine in casual testing but will randomly fail on complex problems. Meanwhile creative tasks are way more forgiving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My conclusion: Q5_K_M is the sweet spot - 95%+ quality, fits on 8GB systems, doesn't randomly break on specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now heres my question would anyone actually pay for a tool that analyzes YOUR specific model/use-case and predicts which quantization to use BEFORE downloading 50GB of different formats?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of building this because I'm tired of the trial-and-error, but want to know if it's just me being lazy or an actual problem people would pay to solve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Even_Ganache6148"&gt; /u/Even_Ganache6148 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p8p844/tested_quantization_on_my_8gb_potato_laptop_heres/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p8p844/tested_quantization_on_my_8gb_potato_laptop_heres/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow the announcement went under the radar, but back in May, along side the Ascent GX10, Asus announced the &lt;a href="https://www.asus.com/displays-desktops/workstations/performance/expertcenter-pro-et900n-g3/"&gt;ExpertCenter Pro ET900N G3&lt;/a&gt;, with GB300 Blackwell. They don't really say what's a &amp;quot;Coherent&amp;quot; memory, but my guess it's another term of saying unified memory like Apple and AMD. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The announcement and the specs are very dry on details, but given the GB300, we might get a very decent memory bandwidth, without &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/pNaKzWb.png"&gt;looking like a hideous frankestein monster&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This might be &lt;a href="/r/Localllama"&gt;r/Localllama&lt;/a&gt; wet dream.

    <title>Benchmarking LLM Inference on RTX PRO 6000 vs H100 vs H200</title>

I present an LLM inference throughput benchmark for RTX PRO 6000 WK vs H100 vs H200 vs L40S GPUs, based on the vllm serve and vllm bench serve benchmarking tools, to understand the cost efficiency of RTX PRO 6000 vs previous-generation datacenter GPUs for LLM inference. Pro 6000 is significantly cheaper and is built on the latest Blackwell architecture, but it has slower GDDR memory and lacks NVLink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/p/fde1798571a1"&gt;Full article on Medium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudrift.ai/blog/benchmarking-rtx6000-vs-datacenter-gpus"&gt;Non-medium link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Benchmarking Setup&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hardware configurations used:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;1xPRO6000; 1xH100; 1xH200; 2xL40s&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;8xPRO6000; 8xH100; 8xH200&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have optimized the benchmark setup for throughput.&lt;/strong&gt; VLLM serves models. The model is split across multiple GPUs using the --tensor-parallel-size VLLM option, if needed. I run as many VLLM instances as possible, using an NGINX load balancer on top to distribute requests across them and maximize throughput (replica parallelism). For example, if only four GPUs are required to run the model on an 8-GPU machine, I run two VLLM instances with --tensor-parallel-size=4 and an NGINX load balancer. If all eight GPUs are required, then a single VLLM instance with --tensor-parallel-size=8 is used.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;vllm bench serve&lt;/strong&gt; tool is used for benchmarking with random data and a sequence length of 1000. The number of concurrent requests is set between 256 and 512 to ensure the LLM's token-generation capacity is saturated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have benchmarked three models to better understand the effect of PCIe communication on the 8xPro6000 server vs. NVLink on the H100/H200.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is the model selection and the logic behind it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5-Air-AWQ-4bit (fits 80GB).&lt;/strong&gt; Testing single-GPU performance and maximum throughput with replica scaling on 8 GPU setups. No PCIE bottleneck. The Pro 6000 should demonstrate strong results thanks to Blackwell native support for FP4.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-AWQ (fits 320GB).&lt;/strong&gt; This 4-bit-quantized model fits into 4 GPUs. Some PCIe communication overhead in Pro 6000 setups may reduce performance relative to NVLink-enabled datacenter GPUs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.6-FP8 (fits 640GB).&lt;/strong&gt; This model requires all eight GPUs. PCIe communication overhead expected. The H100 and H200 configurations should have an advantage.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides raw throughput, graphs show the serving cost per million tokens for each model on its respective hardware. The rental price is set to $2.09 for Pro6000; $2.69 for H100; $3.39 for H200, and $0.86 for L40S - today's rental prices from Runpod secure cloud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For single-GPU workloads&lt;/strong&gt;, RTX PRO 6000 is a clear winner—and arguably an H100 killer. Remarkably, the PRO 6000 with GDDR7 memory outperforms even the H100 SXM with its HBM3e in single-GPU throughput (3,140 vs 2,987 tok/s), while delivering 28% lower cost per token ($0.18 vs $0.25/mtok). The 2xL40S configuration is the least performant and most cost-effective of the bunch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For medium-sized models&lt;/strong&gt; requiring 2-4 GPUs, PRO 6000 remains competitive. While it loses some ground to NVLink-equipped datacenter GPUs, the cost efficiency stays within the same ballpark ($1.03 vs $1.01/mtok for Qwen3-480B).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For large models&lt;/strong&gt; requiring 8-way tensor parallelism, datacenter GPUs pull ahead significantly. The H100 and H200's NVLink interconnect delivers 3-4x the throughput of PCIe-bound PRO 6000s. The cost efficiency gap is significant: $1.72/mtok for Pro6000 vs $0.72-0.76/mtok for H100/H200.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.redd.it/qyda1ooas14g1.gif"&gt;Price in millidollars, i.e. around $0.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.redd.it/69a68sbks14g1.gif"&gt;https://i.redd.it/69a68sbks14g1.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.redd.it/rtyvpiars14g1.gif"&gt;https://i.redd.it/rtyvpiars14g1.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Code and Resources&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The code is available &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudrift-ai/server-benchmark"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

But I really want to know the CPU-only performance of 12+B Dense models so it could help me deciding to get how much RAM needed for expected t/s. Sharing list for reference, it would be great if someone shares stats of these models. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct-GGUF Mistral-Small-3.2-24B-Instruct-2506-GGUF Devstral-Small-2507-GGUF Magistral-Small-2509-GGUF phi-4-gguf RekaAI_reka-flash-3.1-GGUF NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-GGUF NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-GGUF GLM-Z1-32B-0414-GGUF Llama-3_3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1_5-GGUF Qwen3-14B-GGUF Qwen3-32B-GGUF NousResearch_Hermes-4-14B-GGUF gemma-3-12b-it-GGUF gemma-3-27b-it-GGUF &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please share your stats with your config(Total RAM, RAM Type - MT/s, Total Bandwidth) &amp;amp; whatever models(Quant, t/s) you tried. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And let me know if any changes needed in my llama-bench command to get better t/s.

    <title>Compared actual usage costs for Chinese AI models. Token efficiency changes everything.</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone talks about per-token pricing but nobody mentions token efficiency. How many tokens does it take to complete the same task?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tested this with coding tasks cause thats where I actually use these models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;glm-4.6: $0.15 input / $0.60 output Kimi K2: $1.50-2.00 MiniMax: $0.80-1.20 deepseek: $0.28&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;deepseek looks cheapest on paper. But thats not the whole story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Token efficiency (same task):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gave each model identical coding task: &amp;quot;refactor this component to use hooks, add error handling, write tests&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;glm: 8,200 tokens average deepseek: 14,800 tokens average MiniMax: 10,500 tokens average, Kimi: 11,000 tokens average&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;glm uses 26% fewer tokens than Kimi, 45% fewer than deepseek.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Real cost for that task:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;glm: ~$0.04 (4 cents) deepseek: ~$0.03 (3 cents) - looks cheaper MiniMax: ~$0.05 (5 cents) Kimi: ~$0.09 (9 cents)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But wait. If you do 100 similar tasks:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;glm: Total tokens needed: ~820K, Cost: $0.40-0.50 deepseek: Total tokens needed: ~1.48M, Cost: $0.41 - basically same as glm despite lower per-token price MiniMax: Total tokens needed: ~1.05M, Cost: $0.50-0.60 Kimi: Total tokens needed: ~1.1M, Cost: $0.90-1.00&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Token efficiency beats per-token price. glm generates less verbose code, fewer explanatory comments, tighter solutions. deepseek tends to over-explain and generate longer outputs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For businesses doing thousands of API calls daily, glms efficiency compounds into real savings even though its not the absolute cheapest per-token.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Switched to glm for production workloads. Monthly costs dropped 60% vs previous setup. Performance is adequate for 90% of tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;deepseeks pricing looks great until you realize youre using 50% more tokens per task. The savings disappear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone else measuring token efficiency? Feel like this is the underrated metric everyone ignores.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/YormeSachi"&gt; /u/YormeSachi &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p8ven0/compared_actual_usage_costs_for_chinese_ai_models/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p8ven0/compared_actual_usage_costs_for_chinese_ai_models/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>
