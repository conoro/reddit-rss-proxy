An absolute workhorse, from world knowledge to reasoning to role-play, and the best of all “minimal censorship”. GPT-OSS-20B has about 10 mins of usage the whole week in my setup. I like the speed but the model is so bad at hallucinations when it comes to world knowledge, and the tool usage broken half the time is frustrating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only complaint I have about the 24B mistral is speed. On my humble PC it runs at 4-4.5 t/s depending on context size.

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was tinkering with different models (always with llama-server) and was getting frustrated with not finding something for managing presets for the models to lower the hassle of switching and using the right parameters. I wanted to run qwen3, then glm4.5-air, then a stab at Deepseek, now I needed to embed stuff so I wanted Snowflake, and now something else... And I could not find anything online that could help me with it (admittedly, I was extremely lazy in my googling and defaulted to reinventing the wheel... Probably. But it was fun!).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So here it is, Llamarunner is built to be callable from wherever by automatically adding itself to path, installable with a simple curl, and is capable of pulling and building llama.cpp, running your models with presets, and comes with the added bonus of being callable in a pipeline, so if you need to OCR a document, embed it for rag and then use the rag pipeline you can do this all with one single machine!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's the repo, any form of criticism is welcome, right now windows is not supported, and honestly I don't really see myself doing it so, if anybody wants, you are more than welcome to fork.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/GGrassia/llamarunner"&gt;https://github.com/GGrassia/llamarunner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm not a Go dev, it was chosen for ease of development and cross-platform compiling, any non idiomatic stuff comes from there. Knucklehead solutions and bad coding are instead to be blamed on me and somewhat on GLM4.5-Air, but mostly on me, after all, I'm the only possible pebcak here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, I expect some bugs, feel free to open issues and PRs, the only reason this is not a python script on my server is to give back to the community I've been taking and learning so much from.&lt;br /&gt; Cheers!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/GGrassia"&gt; /u/GGrassia &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1my1hg4/llamarunner_a_llamacpp_manager_and_runner_with/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1my1hg4/llamarunner_a_llamacpp_manager_and_runner_with/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>(Alpha Release 0.0.2) Asked Qwen-30b-a3b with Local Deep Think to design a SOTA inference algorithm | Comparison with Gemini 2.5 pro</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;TLDR: A new open-source project called &lt;a href="https://github.com/andres-ulloa-de-la-torre/local-deepthink"&gt;local-deepthink&lt;/a&gt; aims to replicate Google's Ultra 600 dollar-a-month &amp;quot;DeepThink&amp;quot; feature on affordable local computers using only a CPU. This is achieved through a new algorihtm where different AI agents are treated like &amp;quot;neurons&amp;quot;. Very good for turning long prompting sessions into a one-shot, or in coder mode turning prompts into Computer Science research. The results are cautiously optimistic when compared against Gemini 2.5 pro with max thinking budget.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hey all, I've posted several times already but i wanted to show some results from this project I've been working on. Its called local-deepthink. We tested a few QNNs (Qualitative Neural Network) made with local-deepthink on conceptualizing SOTA new algorithms for LLMs. For this release we now added a coding feature with access to a code sandbox. Essentially you can think of this project as a way to max out a model performance trading response time for quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However if you are not a programmer think instead of local-deepthink as a nice way to handle prompts that require ultra long outputs. You want to theorycraft a system or the lore of an entire RPG world? You would normally prompt your local model manytimes, figure out different system prompts; but with local-deepthink you give the system a high level prompt, and the QNN figures out the rest. At the end of the run the system gives you a chat that allows you to pinpoint what data are you interested in. An interrogator chain takes your points and then exhaustively interrogates the hidden layers output based on the points of interest, looking for relevant stuff to add to an ultra long final report. The nice thing about QNNs is that system prompts are figured out on the fly. Fine tuning an LLM with a QNN dataset, might make system prompts obsolete as the trained LLM after fine tuning would implicitly figure the “correct persona” and dynamically switch its own system prompt during it's reasoning process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For diagnostic purposes you can chat with a specific neuron and diagnose it's accumulated state. QNNs unlike numerical Deep Learning are extremely human interpretable. We built a RAG index for the hidden layer that gathers all the utterances every epoch. You can prompt the diagnostic chat with e.g agent_1_1 and get all that specific neurons history. The progress assessment and critique combined, account figuratively for a numerical loss function. These functions unlike normal neural nets which use fixed functions are updated every epoch based on an annealing procedure that allows the hidden layer to become unstuck from local mínima. The global loss function dynamically swaps personas: e.g &amp;quot;lazy manager&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;philosopher king&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;harsh drill sargent&amp;quot;...etc lol&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides the value of what you get after mining and squeezing the LLM, its super entertaining to watch the neurons interact with each other. You can query neighbor neurons in a deep run using the diagnostic chat and see if they &amp;quot;get along&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSTtLWpM3uU"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSTtLWpM3uU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We prompted a few small net sizes on SOTA plausible AI stuff. I don't have access to deepthink because I'm broke so it would be nice if someone rich with a good local rig, plus a google ultra subscription, opened an issue and helped benchmark a 6x6 QNN (or bigger). This is still alpha software with access to a coding sandbox, so proceed very carefully. Thinking models aint supported yet. If you run into a crash, please open an issue with your graph monitor trace log. This works with Ollama and potentially any instruct model you want; if you can plug-in better models than Qwen 30b a3b 2507 instruct, more power to you. Qwen 30b is a bit stupid with meta agentic prompting so the system in a deep run will sometimes crash. Any ideas on what specialized model of comparative size and efficiency is good for nested meta prompting? Even gemini 2.5 pro misinterprets things in this regard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2X2 or 4x4 networks are ideal for cpu-only laptops with 32gb of RAM 3 or 4 epochs max so it stays comparable to Google Ultra. 6X6 all the way to 10x10 with more than 2 epochs up to 10 epochs should be doable with 64 gb in 45 min- 20min as long as you have a 24 gb GPU. If you are coding, this is better for conceptual algorithms where external dependencies can be plugged in later. Better ask for vanilla code. If you are a researcher building algorithms from scratch, you could check out the results and give this a try.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Features we are working in: p2p networking for “collaborative mining” (we call it mining because we are basically squeezing all posible knowledge from an LLM) and a checkpopint mechanism that allows you to pick the mining run where you left, or make the system more crash resistant; I’m already done adding more AI centric features so whats next is polish and debug what already exists until a beta phase is achieved; but im not a very good tester so i need your help. Use cases: local deepthink is great for problems where the only clue you have is a vague question or for one shotting very long prompting sessions. Next logical step is to turn this heuristic into a full software engineering stack for complex things like videogame creation: adding image analysis, video analysis, video generation, and 3d mesh generation neurons. Looking for collaborators with a desire to push local to SOTA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things where i currently need help:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- Hunt bugs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- Deep runs with good hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- Thinking models support&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- P2P network grid to build big QNNs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- Checkpoint import and export. Plug-in in your own QNN and save it as a file. Say you prompted an RPG story with many characters and you wish to continue&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The little benchmark prompt:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Current diffusers and transformer architectures use integral samplers or differential solvers in the case of diffusers, and decoding algorithms which account as integral, in the case of transformers, to run inference; but never both together. I presume the foundation of training and architecture are already figured out, so i want a new inference algorithm. For this conceptualization assume the world is full of spinning wheels (harmonic oscillators), like we see them in atoms, solar systems, galaxies, human hierarchies...etc, and data represents a measured state of the &amp;quot;wheel&amp;quot; at a given time. Abudant training data samples the full state of the &amp;quot;wheel&amp;quot; by offering all the posible data of the wheels full state. This is where full understanding is reached: by spinning the whole wheel.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;code&gt;Current inference algoritms onthe other hand, are not fully decoding the internal &amp;quot;implicit wheels&amp;quot; abstracted into the weights after training as they lack a feedback and harmonic mechanism as it is achieved by backprop during training. The training algorithms “encodes” the &amp;quot;wheels&amp;quot; but inference algorithms do not extract them very well. Theres information loss.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;code&gt;I want you to make in python with excellent documentation:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. An inference algorithm that uses a PID like approach with perturbative feedback. Instead of just using either an integrative or differential component, i want you to implement both with proportional weighting terms. The inference algorithm should sample all its progressive output and feed it back into the transformer.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2. The inference algorithm should be coded from scratch without using external dependencies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/andres-ulloa-de-la-torre/local-deepthink-findings/blob/main/README.md"&gt;Results | Gemini 2.5 pro vs pimped Qwen 30b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please support if you want to see more opensource work like this 🙏&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Temporary_Exam_3620"&gt; /u/Temporary_Exam_3620 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mxobcn/alpha_release_002_asked_qwen30ba3b_with_local/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mxobcn/alpha_release_002_asked_qwen30ba3b_with_local/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

This configuration pushes the limits of desktop AI computing while remaining true to the spirit of garage innovation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Our build includes:&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intel Core i7-13700K (16-core, Raptor Lake)&lt;/strong&gt; — providing blistering performance while drawing just enough power to trip a breaker when combined with three GPUs and a space heater.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;96 GB DDR5-6400 CL32&lt;/strong&gt; — a nonstandard but potent memory loadout, because symmetry is for people with disposable income.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three GPUs stacked without shame:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;MSI SUPRIM X RTX 4080 16 GB (the crown jewel)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;NVIDIA Tesla V100 16 GB PCIe (legacy, but it still screams)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;AMD Radeon Instinct MI50 32 GB (scientific workloads… allegedly)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four NVMe SSDs&lt;/strong&gt; totaling 12 TB, each one a different brand because who has time for consistency.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual PSU arrangement&lt;/strong&gt; (Corsair RM1000x + EVGA SuperNOVA 750 G2), mounted precariously like exposed organs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gPOS17 doesn’t just support cutting-edge multimodal AI pipelines — it redefines workstation thermodynamics with its patented &lt;strong&gt;weed-assisted cooling system&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;gravity-fed cable management architecture&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not just a PC; it’s a statement. A cry for help. A shrine to performance-per-dollar ratios.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The result is a workstation capable of running simultaneous experiments, from large-scale text generation to advanced field simulations, all without leaving your garage (though you might leave it on fire).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;*AMD Radeon Instinct MI50 not shown because it's in the mail from ebay.&lt;br /&gt; **diagram may not be accurate&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Lux_Interior9"&gt; /u/Lux_Interior9 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1my15gf"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1my15gf/gpos17_ai_workstation_with_3_gpus_96_gb_ddr5/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <title>Will most people eventually run AI locally instead of relying on the cloud?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people use AI through the cloud - ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc. That makes sense since the biggest models demand serious compute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But local AI is catching up fast. With things like LLaMA, Ollama, MLC, and OpenWebUI, you can already run decent models on consumer hardware. I’ve even got a &lt;strong&gt;2080 and a 3080 Ti sitting around&lt;/strong&gt;, and it’s wild how far you can push local inference with quantized models and some tuning. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For everyday stuff like summarization, Q&amp;amp;A, or planning, smaller fine-tuned models (7B–13B) often feel “good enough.” - I already posted about this and received mixed feedback on this&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So it raises the big question: &lt;strong&gt;is the future of AI assistants local-first or cloud-first?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Local-first means you own the model, runs on your device, fully private, no API bills, offline-friendly.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cloud-first means massive 100B+ models keep dominating because they can do things local hardware will never touch.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe it ends up hybrid? local for speed/privacy, cloud for heavy reasoning, but I’m curious where this community thinks it’s heading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 5 years, do you see most people’s main AI assistant running on their &lt;strong&gt;own device&lt;/strong&gt; or still in the &lt;strong&gt;cloud&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Significant-Cash7196"&gt; /u/Significant-Cash7196 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mxvh1w/will_most_people_eventually_run_ai_locally/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mxvh1w/will_most_people_eventually_run_ai_locally/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>How close can non big tech people get to ChatGPT and Claude speed locally? If you had $10k, how would you build infrastructure?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the title says, if you had $10k or maybe less, how you achieve infrastructure to run local models as fast as ChatGPT and Claude? Would you build different machines with 5090? Would you stack 3090s on one machine with nvlink (not sure if I understand how they get that many on one machine correctly), add a thread ripper and max ram? Would like to hear from someone that understands more! Also would that build work for fine tuning fine? Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: I am looking to run different models 8b-100b. I also want to be able to train and fine tune with PyTorch and transformers. It doesn’t have to be built all at once it could be upgraded over time. I don’t mind building it by hand, I just said that I am not as familiar with multiple GPUs as I heard that not all models support it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit2: I find local models okay, most people are commenting about models not hardware. Also for my purposes, I am using python to access models not ollama studio and similar things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/EducationalText9221"&gt; /u/EducationalText9221 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mxr6zi/how_close_can_non_big_tech_people_get_to_chatgpt/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mxr6zi/how_close_can_non_big_tech_people_get_to_chatgpt/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA have just published a paper claiming SLMs (small language models) are the future of agentic AI. They provide a number of claims as to why they think so, some important ones being they are cheap. Agentic AI requires just a tiny slice of LLM capabilities, SLMs are more flexible and other points. The paper is quite interesting and short as well to read. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paper : &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02153"&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02153&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Video Explanation : &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kFcjtHQk74"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kFcjtHQk74&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Technical-Love-8479"&gt; /u/Technical-Love-8479 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mxrarl/nvidia_new_paper_small_language_models_are_the/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mxrarl/nvidia_new_paper_small_language_models_are_the/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

The subreddit has grown to 500k users - inevitably, some users like a niche community with more technical discussion and fewer memes (even if relevant).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have a discord bot to test out open source models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better contest and events organization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Best for quick questions or showcasing your rig!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/HOLUPREDICTIONS"&gt; /u/HOLUPREDICTIONS &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mpk2va"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mpk2va/announcing_localllama_discord_server_bot/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>
